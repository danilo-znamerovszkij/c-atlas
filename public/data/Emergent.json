    "summary": "This theory posits that consciousness is not fundamental but arises naturally as a new nonphysical substance (the first-person subject) when a complex arrangement of physical matter, such as biological neurons, achieves a critical threshold of organization. This emergence is governed by unrevealed natural meta-psychophysical laws that transition complexity into nonphysical reality.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as a resultant nonphysical substance that emerges from complex physical arrangements (like brains) via meta-psychophysical processes.",
    "ontological_status": "Dualism (specifically, a substance dualism achieved through a natural emergent process, sometimes characterized as 'dualism-light').",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Physical complexity (brain function) causes the emergence of a nonphysical mental substance (the subject). This new substance is causally generated by and possibly tethered to the physical world, mitigating the traditional 'pairing problem' of interactionism.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Strong Emergence. Justification: The process yields a qualitatively new and nonphysical substance (the subject) from purely physical components, meaning the resultant entity cannot be reduced to or predicted by lower-level physical laws alone.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "The emergent nonphysical substance constitutes the irreducible first-person subject of the mind or consciousness. Specific mechanisms for intentionality are not detailed but are attributed to this new substance.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are properties inherent to or realized within the newly emerged nonphysical substance/subject, arising from the underlying meta-psychophysical laws that generate it.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical matter (complexly organized atoms, e.g., in brains), meta-psychophysical laws (currently unknown natural laws), and a newly emergent nonphysical substance (the conscious subject/soul).",
    "epistemic_access": "Speculative. Knowledge relies on discovering the unknown natural meta-psychophysical laws responsible for generating the nonphysical substance.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "Complex arrangements of physical atoms (e.g., in biological neurons) reaching a critical threshold trigger the emergence of the nonphysical substance, which serves as the organizational structure of consciousness."

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "A threshold of physical complexity triggers unknown natural meta-psychophysical laws, generating a separate nonphysical substance/component.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness arises dynamically and naturally once physical complexity reaches a critical level, subsequently sustained by the properties of the emergent nonphysical substance (which may or may not depend on the continued existence of the brain).",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized to complex physical structures (such as biological neurons/brains) where the complexity threshold for emergence is met. The emergent substance is conceived as 'tethered in space'.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The emergent nonphysical substance is the subject of experience and is causally efficacious. The pairing problem is mitigated because the substance is generated by, and linked to, the physical structure.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved through the unitary nature of the newly emerged nonphysical substance which functions as the single first-person subject.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "The theory focuses primarily on ontological emergence rather than detailed information processing flows.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The process is considered 'natural,' implying that consciousness emerged at a specific point in phylogenetic history when complex physical structures reached the level necessary to activate the meta-psychophysical laws.",

      "stance": "Likely",
