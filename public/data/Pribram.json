    "theory_title": "Pribram’s Holonomic Brain Theory",
    "summary": "This theory proposes that human consciousness arises from quantum effects occurring within or between brain cells, causing the brain to function as a holographic information storage network. This holographic nature means information, particularly memory, is stored non-locally across neural networks, enabling robust function even after damage.",

    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Consciousness is linked to the organized retrieval and reconstruction of holographic information patterns, facilitating rapid associative memory necessary for subjective experience and enabling perception that transcends simple feedforward processing.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are implicitly accounted for by the non-local, holographic storage structure, which allows the entirety and unity of the complex stored information (memory/perception) to be reconstructed from any part.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Quantum effects/processes, dendritic webs, wave interference patterns, Hilbert phase space, and non-local memory distribution.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible via theoretical inference from observed phenomena (e.g., non-local memory effects in brain lesions) and mathematical modeling, such as holographic principles.",

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Holographic analogy, where non-local storage of information in interference patterns ensures that all stored content can be accessed from any part of the memory network.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness arises dynamically as quantum effects generate oscillations that create interference patterns, which then encode and reconstruct experience.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Distributed and non-local, residing in electric oscillations in the dendritic webs of neurons, particularly in relation to the non-local storage of memory.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Enables fast associative memory that rapidly connects disparate pieces of stored information and provides robustness against localized brain damage.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is solved by the holographic nature of the information itself; like a hologram, every part of the field contains the entire information necessary to reconstruct the unified percept.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is flow and representation encoded in wave interference patterns, stored across the neural network rather than in specific local circuits.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The theory focuses on the mechanical means by which consciousness and non-local memory function, rather than providing an explicit phylogenetic account for the origin of this mechanism.",

    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise physical substrate of the quantum storage and the mechanism for maintaining quantum coherence remain unknown and are largely dismissed by mainstream science.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent within an extended model of quantum physics and information theory, but fundamentally incompatible with classical reductionist materialism."

      "stance": "Conditional",

      "stance": "Highly Unlikely/No",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is tied to the emergent quantum dynamics within the physical brain's dendritic webs; the destruction of this physical structure would typically entail the termination of consciousness, consistent with a physicalist ontology."
