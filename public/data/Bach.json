    "summary": "This theory offers a functional explanation of phenomenal consciousness, proposing that cortical structures, particularly a computational entity called the 'conductor,' are trained through reward-driven learning to regulate brain activity. Consciousness is identified as the reconstructed memory of having had an experience, integrated into a protocol for reflection and learning.",

    "integration_or_binding": "The conductor is the sole location where experience is integrated into the protocol, providing central coherence.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information flow is regulated by the conductor and integrated into a protocol. Phenomenal consciousness involves reactivating this protocol via stored links and parameters (memory).",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The main tension lies in the definition of phenomenal consciousness as merely a memory of experience, side-stepping the hard problem by claiming the actuality of the experience itself is irrelevant.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The theory relies heavily on a functional definition that avoids explaining the intrinsic qualitative nature of 'what it is like' to have that experience, focusing instead on the accessible memory thereof.",
