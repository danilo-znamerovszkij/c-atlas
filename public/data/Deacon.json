    "summary": "This theory asserts that the origins of life and consciousness both depend on the emergence of self, which is the organizational core of self-creating, self-sustaining, constraint-generating processes embodied in neural dynamics. Consciousness itself is characterized primarily as a matter of constraint, requiring emergent dynamics that regulate the integrity of the self against increasing entropy.",

    "AI_consciousness": {

      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "Since the self is defined by the logic and constraint-generating processes of neural signal dynamics, a sufficiently accurate replication of these dynamics in a non-biological medium should preserve the conscious self, allowing for virtual immortality."
