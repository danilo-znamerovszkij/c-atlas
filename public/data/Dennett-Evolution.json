    "theory_title": "Dennett’s Evolution of Minds",
    "summary": "This framework posits that the mind and consciousness are entirely the result of evolution by natural selection, emphasizing that complex organization (design, reasons, competence) arose without requiring a conscious designer or reasoner. It explains the development of human minds through successive, purely material levels of abstraction and complexity.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness and mind are identified as highly complex physical processes—an evolved suite of thinking tools built upon material processes, where the 'magic' of the mind is accomplished without magic.",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Identity theory/Reductionist. Mental states are wholly the product of biological brains, explained fully by physical states, consistent with Dennett's broader materialist stance.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence. Consciousness is fully explainable in principle by underlying physical processes, rejecting the need for strong emergence or non-physical intervention.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is constructed via evolved organizational structures, such as the 'center of narrative gravity'. Intentionality (aboutness) arises when complicated clumps of molecules evolve the capacity to have meaning or content.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (qualitative feel) are treated as incoherent and illusory 'user-illusions'—complex, activated neural networks resulting from the evolutionary process, rather than intrinsic, unanalyzable mental properties.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical world, natural laws, biological brains, and natural selection processes.",
    "epistemic_access": "Third-person perspective of science, specifically using the method of heterophenomenology to treat introspective claims as data to be explained, not as true accounts of mental reality.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The structure of the mind consists of an elaborate kit of evolved 'thinking tools' and hierarchical organizational layers built upon biological evolution."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phylogenetic Origin, Content, Mind structure, Consciousness (deflated/illusionary), Self-awareness (as narrative construction).",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The immense power of evolution by natural selection, which creates results characterized by 'reasons without a reasoner, design without a designer, and competence without comprehension'.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness arose through a gradual, incrementalistic process of mental development across phylogenetic history, traceable from early life forms to human minds.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized in the complex brains of higher organisms, particularly humans, where advanced organization of neural activity supports complex 'thinking tools'.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Mind arose because it provided an adaptive, fitness-enhanced advantage in challenging environments. Its function is to enable complex behaviors and cognition, like self-reflection.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved via the evolution of content fixation and propagation in the brain which coalesces into a kind of life story or 'center of narrative gravity'.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Evolution enables the brain to process information such that different brain regions generate 'multiple drafts' which compete for attention (fame in the brain), forming a narrative stream.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness is a non-magical, evolutionary achievement where organisms developed complex capabilities like modeling, predicting, and simulating, culminating in human introspection and abstract thought.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "The origin of minds can be explained by biological evolution without recourse to non-physical elements.",
      "The complexity of the human mind is the culmination of evolution, producing specialized 'thinking tools'.",
      "Phenomenal properties are incoherent illusions arising from complex, evolved neural activity."

    "testability_status": "Conceptually testable against biological and neo-Darwinian consistency; indirectly supported by neuroscientific findings correlated with functionalist models.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Criticized for sidestepping the 'hard problem' by asserting that consciousness (qualia) is an illusion or pseudo-problem. Opponents question the evolutionary advantage of subjective experience if it is merely an illusion or epiphenomenon.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "Does not provide a direct explanation for the subjective feel of experience, only an explanation for why we *report* having such an experience.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent, using Darwinian evolution as a 'universal acid' to ground all aspects of mind, including traditionally non-material concepts, firmly within a strict physicalist ontology."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "As consciousness is entirely material and results from complex organization (functionalism/materialism), there is no principled prohibition against non-biological intelligences achieving consciousness if the correct complexity is replicated."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is tied wholly to the physical brain; death results in irrevocable and permanent non-existence, unless the self is preserved digitally (virtual immortality)."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Humanistic only",
      "rationale": "The evolutionary process operates by 'design without a designer', meaning there is no inherent cosmic meaning or purpose; meaning is self-created by conscious humans."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is wholly explained by the evolved physical/functional organization of the brain, then a perfect duplication of these neural patterns and pathways in a non-biological medium should preserve the first-person mental self."
