    "summary": "This concept posits that the mind is inherently embodied, meaning that the structure of thought and meaning fundamentally depends on the body’s sensorimotor systems and emotional experiences. It argues that the body and its interaction with the environment are an integral part of what consciousness is, not merely what it does.",

    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence (Inferred, as it is a materialist theory implying that consciousness is reducible in principle, although complexity is high.)",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is tied to the embodied experience; intentionality (directedness of thought) is inherent in the way abstract ideas and language are metaphorically embodied by sensorimotor systems.",

    "location_and_distribution": "The mind is distributed throughout the physical body’s sensorimotor systems, not just localized in the brain.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The functional role is to provide meaningful thought, as comprehension cannot occur without engaging the body’s systems. Consciousness is integral to adaptive functioning.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration occurs through the unified connection of neural circuits to the body, binding sensory, motor, and emotional systems into a cohesive embodied experience.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is represented largely through metaphors derived from bodily experience, structuring abstract concepts based on sensori-motor systems.",
