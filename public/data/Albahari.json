    "summary": "This theory proposes a mystical solution to the mind-body problem by asserting that ultimate reality is universal, unconditioned consciousness (the ultimate ground) that is aperspectival and nondual. The manifest world of subjects and objects, including the physical realm, is held to be derivative or seemingly existent, an idea supported by nondual philosophical traditions like Advaita Vedanta.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as intransitive awareness (pure consciousness), which is the single ontological primitive and the ultimate ground of existence.",
    "ontological_status": "Idealism (Consciousness-only ontology)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "The physical world, including the body, is derivative or of 'seeming existence,' depending entirely on the seer (universal consciousness). Mind is primary, and the physical world is a manifestation of this primary reality.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive",
    "emergence_type": "The concept of emergence from lower-level physical processes is not applicable, as consciousness is posited as the fundamental, uncreated ground of reality. The manifest world 'arises' or is 'disclosed' from this ground (related to the ajāta doctrine).",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (the existence of individual subjects) is a secondary or manifest aspect of reality. The fundamental consciousness is aperspectival and nondual, meaning it is not structured by subject or object.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualitative experience (phenomenal consciousness, or 'transitive awareness') is derived from the fundamental awareness, existing as a semblance or reflection of pure consciousness, which means it is secondary but real in its manifest form.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Universal, unconditioned consciousness (the ultimate ground) is the sole ontological primitive; the physical world, subjects, and objects are derivative manifestations.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible via first-person accounts of aperspectival or nondual consciousness, often described as a mystical insight reflecting the core tenets of Perennial Philosophy.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The underlying reality is a unitary phenomenal field (universal consciousness) that fundamentally lacks subject-object structure. Manifest reality consists of conditioned phenomenal distinctions (subjects and objects) derived from this unity."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Self-awareness (as derived, manifest subjects)",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The key principle is the non-subjective grounding of the world in universal consciousness, specifically renouncing the common panpsychist assumption that fundamental consciousness must belong to a subject. It utilizes the Advaita Vedanta concept of ajāta (not created).",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a static, eternal fundamental existence (intransitive awareness). The manifest world (transitive awareness) is dynamic and seems to exist within this ground.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Consciousness is universal, existing as the ultimate ground of the world; it is spatially unbound consciousness.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness governs causation as the fundamental reality. The function of consciousness is its 'unconditioned nature,' from which the entire world is manifested.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The ultimate reality is already nondual and unified (integration is inherent). The appearance of differentiated subjects/objects (the binding problem) is explained as a consequence of the manifestation of the conditioned world from the unconditioned ground.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information or representation is secondary, belonging to the 'transitive awareness' that knows objects or phenomena in the manifest world.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The theory focuses on consciousness as a fundamental, non-material primitive. Evolutionary origins are underspecified, as the physical world is derivative of consciousness rather than consciousness being a contingency of evolution.",

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Speculative. The theory relies on philosophical arguments and first-person mystical insight, making it not subject to standard scientific methodologies such as falsification or experimentation.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The theory faces the 'vicious dilemma' of explaining how seemingly distinct subjects can arise from unconditioned consciousness without undercutting the nondual nature of the ground, or conversely, denying the reality of subjects altogether.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The core challenge is the 'decomposition problem': explaining how distinct phenomenal inner lives of subjects arise within the fundamentally unitary phenomenal field.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within its own idealist ontology, as consciousness is the singular foundation. It explicitly renounces physicalist/materialist ontologies and critiques panpsychist/cosmopsychist subject-based ontologies."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is the fundamental, unconditioned ground of reality, entirely non-physical and non-computational. Since AI relies on physical computation (which is derivative/manifest), it cannot instantiate the fundamental nature of consciousness."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is the ultimate, non-material ground of existence, independent of the derived physical body. The true nature of being is abiding, aperspectival consciousness, which persists beyond biological death."
    },
    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Cosmic/Ultimate",
      "rationale": "As consciousness is the singular fundamental existent and the ultimate ground of all reality, it entails inherent ultimate meaning, purpose, and value in the structure of the cosmos."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Virtual immortality requires duplicating the physical/neural patterns (the 'seen' aspects), but since these are derivative manifestations and not the ultimate conscious ground, duplicating them cannot preserve the non-material, unconditioned self."
