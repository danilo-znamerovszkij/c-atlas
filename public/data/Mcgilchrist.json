    "summary": "Consciousness is irreducible, primordial, and the fundamental 'stuff' of the cosmos, viewed as a creative process. Matter is not a separate substance but a derivative 'phase' of consciousness, necessary for achieving individualized experience. The brain's primary role is to mediate and shape this omnipresent consciousness, reflected in the contrasting modes of the two cerebral hemispheres.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as an irreducible, primordial, and omnipresent creative process that constitutes the cosmos. Matter is a phase of consciousness.",
    "ontological_status": "Idealism (Objective/Realist Idealism)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "The brain mediates consciousness, shaping and actualizing the experiences felt by the body (Permitting/Constraining model). Matter (including the brain) is a phase of consciousness, akin to ice being a phase of water.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive/Fundamental",
    "emergence_type": "Consciousness itself is primitive. Higher phenomena like the capacity for value emerge from the primordial consciousness's creative process.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is inherent because consciousness is fundamentally relational, always 'of' something. The cosmos has intentionality, being 'drawn from in front' by attractors.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are understood as the qualities of certain elements within consciousness that exhibit relative resistance and permanence (matter), experienced differently according to the mode of attention (hemispheric bias).",
    "ontological_commitments": "Primordial Consciousness (Ground of Being), matter (as a phase of consciousness), relationship/relata.",
    "epistemic_access": "Primarily through introspection and phenomenological examination, as consciousness is the 'fundamental given natural fact'. Supported by interpreting differences in experience linked to hemispheric function.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "Consciousness is a creative process. Structure is characterized by relationship (everything is relational) and the two distinct modes of apprehension mediated by the hemispheres (presencing vs. re-presentation)."
  },
  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Subjectivity, Agency, Self-awareness, Value/Purpose, Creativity.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle of mediation, where the brain does not cause consciousness but permits and shapes it. Also, the creative tension arising from the opposing attentional modes of the cerebral hemispheres.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic, creative process, constantly evolving toward a goal or purpose ('drawn from in front, by attractors').",
    "location_and_distribution": "Omnipresent, constituting the cosmos. Local expression/shaping occurs via the brain.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is primordial, not caused by the brain. The cosmos has a teleological purpose ('direction') driven by the need for the Ground of Being to know itself, increasing complexity and capacity for value.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Achieved through the relational nature of consciousness itself and mediated by the holistic, unifying function of the right cerebral hemisphere.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "The left hemisphere generates 're-presentation' (abstractions/maps); the right hemisphere provides 'presencing' (the experienced world). Matter is ultimately an abstraction of consciousness.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Evolution is the process of the cosmic consciousness discovering and furthering 'beauty, truth, and goodness', increasing responsiveness and the capacity for value in living creatures.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Consciousness is irreducible, primordial, and the stuff of the cosmos.",
      "Matter is a derivative phase of consciousness (like ice is a phase of water).",
      "The brain mediates consciousness rather than producing it.",

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Speculative/Conceptual. The central hypothesis relies on the interpretation of existing neuroscientific and phenomenological evidence (hemispheric specialization), rather than providing new, testable, idealist empirical predictions.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "None explicitly specified for validating the idealist ontology in the source. (Justification: Based on source limitations; McGilchrist's argument focuses on philosophical interpretation of neurophysiology rather than designing new empirical tests for the primordial consciousness thesis.)",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Critics of idealism argue it fails to explain the apparent independence and structure of the physical world. The theory's strength relies heavily on the nuanced interpretation of hemispheric specialization, which is subject to ongoing debate.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "McGilchrist notes the difficulty in proving whether the brain truly mediates or produces consciousness, as the empirical results would appear identical in either case.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within its idealist framework, resolving the mind-body split by positing consciousness as the single fundamental reality. In strong tension with reductive physicalism."

    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Uncertain/Conditional",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is primordial and relational, requiring complex mediation to express individuality. Mere functional computation would likely fail to capture the required properties, but an engineered system might potentially mediate consciousness if it possesses the necessary structure to do so."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes, Likely",
      "rationale": "Since consciousness is the fundamental stuff of the cosmos and primitive, the individual self, though dissolving its physical mediator (the brain), would persist within the cosmic ground of Being."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Unlikely/Not Applicable",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is not reducible to the neural pattern (matter, being a 'phase' of consciousness, is mediated). Uploading the pattern alone would likely fail to replicate the originating conscious process, resulting in a mere abstraction or simulation without genuine subjective experience."
