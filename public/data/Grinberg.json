    "summary": "This psychophysiological theory posits that the brain creates a hypercomplex internal 'neuronal field' resulting from the activation and unification of all its neuronal elements. Consciousness is closely connected to this field, which produces a distortion in the basic space-time structure; our percepts are the perception of this distortion.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is the interaction between the neuronal field and the energetic (syntergic) organization of space. Experience itself exists in a dimension different from the localized physiological activity of the brain.",
    "ontological_status": "Anomalous Monism/Dual-Aspect (Justified: The theory posits 'Reality' as an 'undifferentiated energetic matrix' converted by the brain, suggesting a single fundamental reality but manifested via distinct fields.)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "The human brain converts an 'undifferentiated energetic matrix' (Reality) into neuronal activity and subjective experience. The brain's neuronal field interacts with the space-matter continuum.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Strong Emergence (Justified: Consciousness is reached through hypothesized 'energetic transformations of a qualitative nature' and exists in a different dimension than physiological activity , suggesting non-reducibility.)",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is accounted for as the 'perception of this distortion' of space-time created by the neuronal field. The transformations involve subjective phenomena like 'love, fear'.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualitative experience (qualia) results from 'energetic transformations of a qualitative nature' that take place when cerebral electrochemical changes are combined with experiences of light, sound, love, fear, etc..",
    "ontological_commitments": "Neuronal fields, an 'undifferentiated energetic matrix' (Reality), and the space-matter continuum.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible through psychophysiological studies of the neuronal field and observable non-verbal communication effects between brains, such as 'transferred potentials'.",

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal consciousness, unification of neuronal activity, and emphatic communication between brains.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The neuronal field (created by the brain) generates a distortion in the basic space-time structure, and perceiving this distortion constitutes reality/percepts.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Dynamic process. Consciousness is an ongoing interaction between the neuronal field and the energetic organization of space.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The consciousness is located in the brain's neuronal field, which is intrinsically complex and requires a complex brain to be activated. This field also 'expands into space'.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The neuronal field is responsible for the unification of neuronal activity and enables emphatic non-verbal communication. It is capable of altering the informational content of the space-matter continuum.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved via the neuronal field, which functions as an interaction matrix unifying the activity of all neuronal elements.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is processed by the brain converting the undifferentiated energetic matrix into neuronal activity. The neuronal field can also change the 'informational content' of space.",
    "evolutionary_account": " (Justified: No specific evolutionary account is provided, though the complexity of the brain is noted as a necessary condition for the neuronal field activation.)",

      "The hypercomplex neuronal field unifies activity and is closely connected to consciousness.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The theory pursued fringe areas such as shamanism and its foundational claim that gravitation is a by-product of the neuronal field pushes far beyond contemporary physics.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise mechanism of how the brain converts the undifferentiated energetic matrix into experience, and how the perception of space-time distortion generates specific qualia, remains abstract.",

      "stance": "Possible",
      "rationale": "Consciousness and experience are said to exist in a dimension different from localized physiological brain activity. The inclusion of quantum effects and non-local interactions suggests a potential for persistence outside the physical body."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Cosmic/Philosophical",
      "rationale": "The theory connects consciousness to the fundamental structure of reality, viewing the brain as converting a primary energetic matrix into experience , suggesting deep cosmic significance and integration with existence itself."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Unlikely",
      "rationale": "Virtual immortality would require technological duplication of the precise energetic transformation and the interaction of the neuronal field with the syntergic organization of space , which is highly improbable due to the non-local and unconventional physical assumptions of the theory."
