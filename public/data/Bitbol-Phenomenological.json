    "summary": "This framework aims to dissolve the 'hard problem' of consciousness by emphasizing the primacy of lived experience and viewing the mind-body connection as a 'tangled dialectic' rather than a one-directional physical dependence. It advocates a radical shift in the researcher's stance away from seeking an objective solution toward exploring subjective, first-person reality.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as manifest, given reality (endo-ontology) accessible through lived, first-person experience, which conditions the constitution of objectivity. It is a dynamical and participatory conception of the body-consciousness relation.",
    "ontological_status": "Phenomenological Ontology (Endo-ontology)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind and body exist in a 'tangled dialectic,' where the neuro-phenomenological correlation is merely an extension of the lived sense of embodiment, rejecting one-directional material dependence.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Implicitly Primitive",
    "emergence_type": "Dissolution/Non-reductive",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (lived experience) holds effective primacy. Intentionality, or the 'aboutness' of objects, is derived from experience, as objectivity is constituted by extracting structural invariants from the given experience.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are addressed by the foundational commitment to phenomenal experience as manifest reality. The problem of qualitative feel is dissolved by rejecting the materialist framework that generates it as a 'fake mystery.'",
    "ontological_commitments": "Lived experience, self-manifesting being (endo-ontology), and structural invariants constituted from experience (objectivity). It makes no concession to standard physicalist or dualist commitments.",
    "epistemic_access": "Requires a genuinely first-person stance, achieved through disciplined practices like micro-phenomenological interviews, combined (or braided) with third-person neuroscientific accounts.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "A dynamical and participatory structure, possibly modeled after cybernetic dialectics (Varela), where consciousness is intrinsically related to the physical without dependence."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal consciousness, the hard problem (dissolution), and altered states of consciousness.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The key principle is the dissolution of the hard problem by shifting the focus from an intellectual puzzle to an 'existential option,' achieved through suspending objective judgment and redirecting inquiry toward the constitution of objects from subjective experience.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic flow and a mode of being that is permanently present (proximate mode of being). Its manifestation rejects the problem of physical origin, framing that quest as an ontological prejudice.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The neuro-phenomenological correlation implies consciousness is distributed through the lived sense of embodiment, not localized solely in the bodily brain.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Critiques the assumption of fundamental dependence on the physical brain. Causality is reframed by emphasizing how objectivity is obtained through the coordination of subjective experiences.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Implied by the fundamental unity and coherence of lived experience, which is the starting point of the phenomenological analysis.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information and representation are secondary to experience. Objective science circumscribes features extracted (structural invariants) from manifest reality, similar to how quantum laws express bounds of experimental information (QBism analogy).",

    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Radical neurophenomenology advances Varela's project of criticizing and dissolving the hard problem of consciousness.",
      "The 'hard problem' is a fake mystery generated by the standard physicalist ontological prejudice.",
      "Lived experience has effective primacy over objective accounts, thus neuroscientific data should not be granted a higher ontological status than phenomenological descriptions.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Criticized for avoiding an intellectual solution to the hard problem, instead deflecting it onto the plane of attitudes or being considered a 'dodge.' It requires researchers to adopt self-transformation and abandon the neutral observer stance, which is demanding.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The framework intentionally leaves open the traditional intellectual puzzle of the origin of consciousness, requiring a fundamental shift in philosophical attitude to accept the 'dissolution' as sufficient.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within the tradition of phenomenological ontology, explicitly structured to reject the coherence problems inherent in both standard physicalist monism and property dualism."

      "stance": "No",
