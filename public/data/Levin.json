    "theory_title": "Levin’s Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere (TAME)",
    "summary": "This framework understands mind and cognition through functional, goal-directed activity across diverse, often unconventional substrates, including engineered materials and synthetic biology. It posits that consciousness or sentience is continuous and graded, viewing animal minds as an instance of collective intelligence among cell groups.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness/sentience is identified as goal-directed activity realized in various embodied substrates, often organized as complex perception-action systems.",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism (Materialism)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness is fundamentally embodied, emerging from the configuration and dynamics of the physical substrate (which can be conventional biological tissue, or novel chimeric architectures).",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence (The continuity of consciousness suggests that its complex functional dynamics, which are physical, lead to its appearance without requiring sharp, inexplicable phase transitions.)",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (consciousness per se) is difficult to access objectively. Intentionality is central, tied directly to goal-directed activity and embodied agency.",
    "qualia_account": "The theory focuses on cognitive function and largely remains skeptical about defining phenomenal consciousness (qualia) from a third-person, objective perspective.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical substrates, biological and non-biological (chimeric architectures), cell groups exhibiting collective intelligence, and perception-action systems operating in abstract spaces (e.g., morphogenetic, transcriptional).",
    "epistemic_access": "Primarily through third-person approaches studying goal-directed activity and cognitive function. The intrinsic experience of consciousness remains challenging to access objectively.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The structure of consciousness is continuous and non-binary, realized as a patchwork of diverse consciousnesses (e.g., cell groups) integrated through agency and information flow across various spaces."

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere (TAME) formalizes the creation and manipulation of cognition in unconventional substrates through synthetic biology and bioengineering.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a continuous, graded process that arises gradually, linked to the plasticity and malleability of the physical systems (bodies) on both short (ontogenetic) and long (phylogenetic) timescales.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Distributed across various embodied substrates, not restricted to the brain, and can exist in systems operating in non-3D spaces (e.g., morphogenetic space).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness serves the functional role of supporting strong embodied agency and collective intelligence, driven by goal-directed activity.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved through the formation of collective intelligence within cell groups and the unified operation of perception-action systems.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Based on perception-action systems working in various abstract informational spaces, including transcriptional and morphogenetic spaces.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness evolved gradually, consistent with a relatively smooth continuity across species, arising from evolutionary pressures favoring systems capable of choice and agency.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Consciousness comes in degrees and kinds, challenging the notion of sharp phase transitions.",
      "Sentience is fundamentally tied to observable goal-directed activity.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Critics challenge the rejection of sharp phase transitions, demanding specification of the precise physical change that makes for a qualitative shift in consciousness capacity.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The theory acknowledges its limitation in definitively describing phenomenal consciousness (what consciousness 'is') from an objective, third-person perspective.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent within a functionalist and extended materialist ontology, accommodating diverse substrates while maintaining a physicalist classification."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "Since TAME applies to designed and chimeric materials, artificial systems (if configured as goal-directed, embodied perception-action systems) could plausibly realize consciousness."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "As a materialist framework that ties consciousness to the ongoing function of an embodied physical substrate, survival beyond that substrate’s existence is not supported."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Humanistic/Tied to Agency",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is linked to goal-directed activity, suggesting meaning is derived from the system's inherent agency, rather than cosmic teleology."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "The premise that mind can be engineered and instantiated in novel, non-biological architectures suggests that duplicating and transferring the complex, embodied perception-action system should be possible in principle."
