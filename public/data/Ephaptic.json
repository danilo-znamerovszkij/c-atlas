    "summary": "This theory posits that neurons generate electric fields that are strong enough and precisely placed to instantaneously influence the electrical excitability of adjacent neurons (ephaptic coupling). If this coupling occurs broadly across the brain, it is proposed to be the underlying physical basis that helps constitute an electromagnetic field theory of consciousness.",
