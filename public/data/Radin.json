    "summary": "This perspective challenges materialism by positing that empirical evidence for psi phenomena (such as telepathy and psychokinesis) indicates the existence of a non-local mind. It suggests that consciousness is fundamentally primitive, possibly an 'ocean of consciousness,' from which energy and matter subsequently emerge, refuting the brain-based explanation of consciousness.",

    "ontological_status": "Idealism/Panpsychism (Consciousness as Fundamental)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind is ontologically prior to and causal of matter and energy; thus, the mind is not reducible to brain processes (non-substance dualism).",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive/Fundamental",
    "emergence_type": "Not Applicable (Consciousness is Primitive). Note: Matter and energy are treated as emergent phenomena arising from consciousness.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is primitive, inherent in consciousness; intentionality manifests as a causal power capable of affecting the physical world (force of will/psychokinesis).",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are intrinsic properties of the fundamental 'ocean of consciousness' itself. (Justified: If consciousness is the fundamental substance, its qualitative feel must be intrinsic to that substance.)",
    "ontological_commitments": "Fundamental consciousness (non-local), energy, matter/physical world (emergent from consciousness), and objective reality of psi phenomena.",
    "epistemic_access": "Empirical (via controlled psi experiments and subsequent meta-analyses) and philosophical/inferential (using psi evidence to infer fundamental metaphysics).",

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is static/primitive; the physical world dynamically emerges from this fundamental consciousness, and non-local effects (psi) are the observable manifestations of this underlying reality.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Non-local; distributed universally, likened to an 'ocean of consciousness.'",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is causally efficacious, allowing 'downward causation' where mindful intention (e.g., psychokinesis) influences physical reality, thereby challenging the causal closure of classical physics.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is inferred to be inherent in the holistic, non-local 'ocean of consciousness,' linking individual minds through quantum-oriented relationships.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information transfer, relevant to non-local perception (divination/clairvoyance), occurs outside the constraints of physical space-time due to the non-local nature of mind.",

    ],
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Strongly criticized by skeptics who claim psi effects are due to illusion, delusion, fraud, methodological flaws, statistical errors (Type I errors), or the 'existential impossibility' of psi phenomena. It requires abandoning the established causal closure of classical physics.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The theoretical framework requires robust mechanisms to integrate quantum mechanics and non-locality with consciousness, and must overcome ongoing scientific skepticism regarding the reliability and interpretation of psi data.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Conditional Coherence. Highly coherent within a post-materialistic framework where consciousness is fundamental, but entirely incoherent under standard materialist assumptions (i.e., classical physics' causal closure)."

    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Conditional/Uncertain",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is derived from a fundamental 'ocean' accessible only through specific (likely biological or non-classical) pathways, AI systems' potential for consciousness depends entirely on whether they can access or embody this fundamental, non-local reality."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "By positing consciousness as non-local and fundamental, rather than solely generated by the brain, the model suggests consciousness (the 'ocean' or non-physical component) could persist after the physical body and brain dissolve."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Likely (Cosmic/Ultimate)",

      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "If consciousness relies on a fundamental, non-physical, non-local component, duplicating the physical brain in a virtual substrate would necessarily fail to capture the essential conscious component required for true self-continuity."
