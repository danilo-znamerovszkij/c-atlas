    "summary": "This theory proposes that the mechanism of consciousness is rooted in a fundamental expansion of physical reality derived from quantum theory. Consciousness is attributed to dynamic, holistic quantum processes, specifically via quantum potential energy carrying 'active information,' which complements classical neurological mechanisms that are viewed as a shadow of this deeper reality.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness reflects the dynamic and holistic quantum physical processes, where neurophysiological processes are a 'shadow' of this underlying, deeper level where mind and experience unfold. Active information, carried by quantum potential energy, plays a non-mechanical role.",
    "ontological_status": "Expanded Physicalism/Ontological Interpretation of Quantum Theory (complementary to classical physics)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind/conscious experience reflects deeper, holistic quantum physical processes, while measured neurophysiological processes are a macroscopic manifestation ('shadow') of these underlying dynamics. The fundamental relationship is non-mechanical.",

    "emergence_type": "Strong Emergence",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "The necessity of non-mechanical, organic principles (like active information) provides a basis for accommodating subjective mental states and intentionality, which traditional mechanistic processes struggle to explain.",
    "qualia_account": "Implicitly accounted for by the underlying holistic quantum reality, which precedes the mechanistic neurophysiological descriptions. The dynamics and holistic features of conscious experience reflect the holistic quantum processes.",

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The central mechanism is the introduction of active information and quantum potential energy into the physical description of reality, enabling non-mechanical, holistic dynamics that are complementary to classical neurophysiology.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Conscious experience arises dynamically when the mechanistic classical physical framework is complemented by the action of the deeper, holistic quantum physical processes associated with the brain.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The conscious 'mind' unfolds at a deeper (pre-spatial or 'implicate') level, distinct from the surface neurophysiological processes measured by cognitive neuroscience.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Active information, through non-mechanical means, seeks to provide a way for the mental domain to have causal influence on the physical domain, offering a solution to the problem of mental causation without appealing to causal antifundamentalism.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The holistic features of conscious experience (unity) are directly viewed as reflections of holistic quantum physical processes.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is explicitly integrated as 'active information' within quantum potential energy, transforming matter from a purely mechanical entity into one capable of supporting mental processes.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Not explicitly detailed. Not explicitly addressed, as the theory focuses on the ontological requirement for consciousness to fit into an expanded physical reality rather than its phylogenetic development.",

    "open_questions_and_limitations": "Requires validation that active information indeed constitutes a non-mechanical form of reality capable of supporting and generating conscious processes. The theory requires physics beyond the currently known classical or quantum frameworks.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within its specific foundation (Bohmian mechanics/Expanded Physicalism), as it explicitly attempts to integrate mind by restructuring the nature of the physical reality itself."
