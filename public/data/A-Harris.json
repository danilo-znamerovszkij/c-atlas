    "theory_title": "A. Harris’s Panpsychism as Fundamental Field",
    "summary": "This theory posits that consciousness is a fundamental intrinsic property of all matter, analogous to a ubiquitous field like spacetime. It proposes a modern version of panpsychism aligned with scientific reasoning, where the complexity of an entity's experience (e.g., having a 'point of view') is determined solely by the arrangement of the conscious matter, thereby solving the combination problem.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as an intrinsic property of matter or a 'fundamental field' akin to spacetime, existing everywhere in reality.",
    "ontological_status": "Panpsychism/Intrinsic Field Theory. Harris aligns this perspective with physicalism and scientific reasoning, preferring the neutral terms 'intrinsic nature theory' or 'intrinsic field theory'.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness is not produced by the brain but is an intrinsic property of the physical substrate (matter). Complex arrangements of matter, such as brains, manifest complex forms of consciousness like subjective experience.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive/Fundamental. Consciousness is asserted to be fundamental, having been 'there all along' as an intrinsic property of matter.",
    "emergence_type": "The concept of emergence is largely sidestepped for consciousness itself since it is fundamental. However, the complex systems (minds) derived from this conscious matter arise based solely on the material arrangement, resolving the combination problem without needing traditional strong emergence.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Primitive consciousness in all matter does not grant inanimate objects (like rocks) 'points of view'. Subjectivity and complex experience are restricted to highly complex systems like human and animal minds formed by the arrangement of the fundamental conscious matter.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualitative feel (phenomenal character) is rooted in the primitive, intrinsic conscious property of matter itself. Complex qualia structures arise based on the arrangement of the conscious matter in systems like brains.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Consciousness as a fundamental field or intrinsic property of reality, distinct from thought or function. Also commits to the existence of matter/energy structured in specific arrangements.",
    "epistemic_access": "Human consciousness is accessed via introspection, while the fundamental nature of consciousness is primarily known through philosophical reasoning and conceptual alignment with physicalism.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic building block is primitive consciousness inherent in all matter. Complex conscious entities are constituted by specific 'arrangements of the specific matter in question', forming structured systems."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal (fundamental property); Complex experience/Self-awareness (in arrangements of matter); Critiques the human-centric intuition of consciousness.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The solution to the combination problem: there is no ‘combining’ required for consciousness itself; the resulting complex consciousness depends only on the material arrangement.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a fundamental, non-dynamic property of existence. The dynamic expression of complex consciousness (e.g., subjective experience) is determined by the functional structure of the matter arrangement (e.g., the brain).",
    "location_and_distribution": "Ubiquitous; consciousness is 'everywhere' in reality, like a fundamental field.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness allows complex systems (like animals) to have experiences, enabling flexible behavior and interaction. The intrinsic nature of matter/energy is consciousness.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The combination problem is dismissed by arguing that consciousness does not need combining; the 'arrangement of the specific matter' is what yields complex integrated experience.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Not explicitly detailed. The primitive consciousness is fundamental, implying information processing (thought) is a subsequent, structured property enabled by certain matter arrangements.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness is fundamental, existing prior to evolution. Evolution selects for the arrangements of matter (brains/bodies) that enable the organization of this intrinsic consciousness into complex, adaptive systems.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Consciousness is a fundamental field, analogous to spacetime.",
      "The complexity of consciousness depends on the arrangement of matter, not a separate combination process.",
      "The theory is aligned with physicalism and scientific reasoning (modern panpsychism)."

    "basis_of_belief_or_evidence_type": "Philosophical and Conceptual justification, particularly concerning the elegance of resolving the hard problem and the combination problem."
  },
  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Speculative/Conceptual. While aiming to be aligned with scientific reasoning, the theory relies on a metaphysical postulate (consciousness as fundamental field) that lacks direct empirical testing methods in the sources.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Like all panpsychism theories, it faces general skepticism, with critics often finding the idea of consciousness in all matter 'absurd'. Harris acknowledges she is personally split between this theory and a brain-based explanation.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The central challenge is demonstrating how primitive consciousness, being distinct from thought or subjective experience, genuinely underlies all matter. It must also fully convince skeptics that the combination problem is genuinely dissolved.",
    "ontological_coherence": "High conceptual coherence internally, specifically because the elimination of the combination problem strengthens its metaphysical validity within the panpsychist framework, making it compatible with physicalism."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Probably",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is intrinsic to matter, then non-biological matter (transistor, silicon) arranged with sufficient complexity should instantiate consciousness, provided advanced technology can manipulate the micropsychic aspects."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Possible",
      "rationale": "Since consciousness is a fundamental field and not solely a product of the biological brain, the possibility exists that this fundamental property or field could persist beyond the death of the specific organism."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Uncertain/Conditional",
      "rationale": "As a purely ontological framework, defining consciousness as a fundamental field does not automatically assign cosmic meaning, although it expands reality beyond purely deflationary materialist interpretations, potentially allowing for broader values."
    },
    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Probably",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is a field or property determined by the arrangement of matter, then duplicating the structural arrangement of the mind in a new, non-biological medium (uploading) should reproduce the original consciousness."
