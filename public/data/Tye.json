    "theory_title": "Tye’s Contingentism",
    "summary": "This theory asserts that phenomenal conscious states are literally identical to specific physical or brain states in our actual world. However, crucially, this identity is understood as contingent, meaning it is not metaphysically necessary across all possible worlds. This modal claim is intended to solve the hard problem by accepting that the conceivability of philosophical zombies (unconscious physical duplicates) is irrelevant to the truth of physicalism in the actual world.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Phenomenal character (Q) is identified as one and the same as a physical property (R), where R may include functional states or states posited by representationalism. This identity holds only contingently in our world.",
    "ontological_status": "Reductive Physicalism (broadly construed to include functionalism and representationalism), although Tye later expressed distance from thoroughgoing reductive physicalism.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Contingent Identity Theory. Mental states (sensations) are literally identical to physical states/brain processes, but this identity is a contingent fact, not a necessity in all possible worlds.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity and phenomenal character are reduced to or identified with representational content (First-Order Representationalism). Phenomenal character is fixed not just by current states but also by past states ('history matters crucially to phenomenology').",
    "qualia_account": "Qualitative character (Q) is identical with a physical property (R). The ability to imagine Q without R (zombies) is acknowledged as intelligible but dismissed as irrelevant because it describes only a metaphysically possible world, not the actual world, thereby resolving the explanatory gap.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical states of some sort, encompassing neurophysiological states, functional states, and representational contents, which are grounded in microphysical states.",
    "epistemic_access": "Consciousness is accessed through subjective experience (phenomenology) and studied through philosophical and modal analysis, which is used to argue for the contingent nature of its physical realization.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "Consciousness consists of physical states (R) realized in the brain, or equivalently, representational contents, where the history of the individual is crucial to determining the phenomenal character at a given time."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal states (qualia), the hard problem of consciousness, and its relationship to physical states.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle that identity statements concerning consciousness (Q=R) can be contingent, distinguishing the consciousness case from typical necessary scientific identities (like water=H2O), thus eliminating the explanatory puzzle.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a physical phenomenon in the actual world. Although it might have evolved gradually (Tye’s later evolutionary views) the core dynamic is the contingent identity relation itself.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The physical states (R) that consciousness is identical with are located in the brain, including neurophysiological states, functional states, or representational states.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "If physicalism is true, consciousness is physical and thus its causal efficacy and emergence issues can be handled satisfactorily within the physical world's causal closure.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The theory focuses primarily on the identity relation of phenomenal character. Integration is implicitly handled through the underlying mechanisms of physical, functional, or representational states, consistent with a reductionist framework.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "The theory is compatible with representationalism, viewing experiences in a representationalist and broadly reductionist way, where phenomenal character is identical to representational content.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness was not absent prior to a specific evolutionary moment but was foundational (proto-consciousness always present), while varying conscious states appeared gradually, addressing the 'vagueness' in assessing consciousness evolutionarily.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Phenomenal states are contingently identical to physical states (Q=R) in the actual world.",
      "The hard problem dissolves upon realizing that the conceivable possibility of Q without R (zombie) refers only to a metaphysically possible world, not the actual world.",

    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The core tenet relies on holding that the identity of conscious states is contingent while other scientific identity statements are necessary, which critics might challenge. The argument acknowledges the conceivability of philosophical zombies while denying their relevance to the actual world.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "Tye ultimately expressed doubt regarding a thoroughgoing reductive physicalism, believing that an element of consciousness cannot be captured by higher-level reductions, leading him toward a form of panpsychism.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within the framework of orthodox a posteriori physicalism, providing a philosophical tool to maintain physicalism in the face of the knowledge argument.",
