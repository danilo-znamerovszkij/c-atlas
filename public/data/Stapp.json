    "summary": "This theory posits that consciousness is fundamental to the universe and relies on a traditional interpretation of quantum mechanics where consciousness causes the collapse of the quantum wave function (an act of measurement) . This mechanism provides consciousness with a crucial causal role in the physical world, linking an agent's free choice to the physical actualization of neural correlates .",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified with the phenomenal aspects of \"events\" (quantum jumps) that occur when an observer chooses a specific measurement or \"question\" to ask, forcing the physical state to actualize in a manner compatible with the resulting phenomenal experience .",
    "ontological_status": "Non-Materialist (Fundamental Consciousness based on Quantum Mechanics). Consciousness is viewed as an independent existence required to complete the causal dynamics of the universe, defeating classical materialism .",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Causal dynamical linkage (Interactionist). A causal connection is established between a person's conscious choices of how to act (mind) and the physical actualizations of the neural correlates (matter) via the quantum jump .",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive (Fundamental). Consciousness is fundamental to the universe and is necessary to make quantum theory work, arguing that the mental process cannot simply be a product of the brain .",
    "emergence_type": "The theory posits consciousness as a fundamental, independent existence, necessary to complete the causal dynamics of quantum mechanics, thus avoiding emergence from purely physical processes.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is tied to the 'phenomenal aspects' of the quantum event, corresponding to the conscious acquisition of knowledge . Intentionality is expressed through the agent's free choice regarding what question to ask or how to act .",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are the phenomenal aspects of the 'events' (quantum jumps/wave function collapse) that occur when a conscious choice is made, constituting increments of experienced knowledge .",
    "ontological_commitments": "Quantum wave functions, physical states, brain states, and consciousness itself as an independent, non-physical existence capable of selecting basis states .",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessed primarily through the logical/conceptual interpretation of quantum mechanics (Von Neumann's formulation), linking conscious experience (first-person knowledge increments) to objective physical state changes (quantum jumps in the brain) .",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The structure involves quantum events in the observer's brain state, particularly localized at the synapses between neurons (exploiting quantum effects of calcium ions), where the quantum wave function collapses to a state compatible with the phenomenal experience ."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Agency, Free Will, Knowledge Acquisition, Causal Action in the physical world .",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Consciousness addresses the 'critical causal gap' in quantum mechanics by determining the choice of measurement ('question to ask'), which causes the wave function (potentialities) to collapse into an actual physical event .",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic process required to initiate the quantum jump, interrupting the purely deterministic evolution described by the Schrödinger equation and causing actual physical events .",
    "location_and_distribution": "The physical effects focus on quantum processes within the brain, specifically involving the quantum effects of calcium ions in neural synapses (cerebral exocytosis) . Consciousness itself is fundamental to the universe .",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness plays an essential, non-passive causal role by influencing the brain's physical state (through the collapse mechanism), thereby enabling agency and actual events to happen .",
    "integration_or_binding": "The sources do not explicitly detail how sensory inputs are unified or bound into a coherent conscious whole within this model, focusing instead on the causal role of conscious choice in quantum state reduction.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "The agent's choice sets the basis states (the 'question') for information selection , and the 'Yes' feedback experience represents the conscious acquisition of knowledge .",
    "evolutionary_account": "Implicitly adaptive, as consciousness is granted a causal role necessary to make quantum theory work, solving the 'mystery why consciousness should ever come into existence' under classical models .",

      "The ontological foundations of consciousness and quantum mechanics are inextricably linked .",

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Conceptually testable, as it identifies specific physical loci (synaptic quantum effects) , but requires verification of non-classical quantum phenomena in the warm, wet brain.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "Specific direct tests are not listed, but the theory identifies potential physical loci for investigation (quantum effects involving calcium ions during cerebral exocytosis) .",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Criticized for relying on a non-standard interpretation of quantum mechanics (consciousness-induced collapse) that is widely dismissed in mainstream physics . The conclusions are highly controversial .",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The core unresolved issue is the philosophical nature of the 'independent existence' that performs the measurement choice, which lies outside quantum mechanics itself .",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within its chosen quantum framework (Von Neumann interpretation) , but severely inconsistent with the physicalist presupposition of causal closure common in classical and mainstream neuroscience ."

      "stance": "Uncertain/Conditional",

      "stance": "Maybe",
      "rationale": "The theory establishes consciousness as fundamental and inextricably linked to quantum reality , suggesting that the destruction of the classical brain does not necessarily entail the end of the fundamental conscious entity, though first-person survival remains difficult to imagine ."
