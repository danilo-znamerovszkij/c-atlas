    "theory_title": "Metzinger’s No-Self Representational Theory of Subjectivity",
    "summary": "This theory offers a representationalist and functional analysis of subjectivity, positing that the phenomenal self—the consciously experienced first-person perspective—is not a real entity but an ongoing process, specifically the content of a transparent self-model in the brain. Conscious thought is largely characterized as a non-agentive, unintentional form of inner behavior.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness, or phenomenal self, is identified as the content of a “transparent self-model,” which is functionally integrated representational events (the Epistemic Agent Model, EAM).",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism (Inferred). The theory falls under Materialism and attempts to dissolve dualistic intuitions by explaining them as artifacts of representational structure.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "The mind/phenomenal self is the result of physical, subpersonal processes in the brain (functional integration of representational events). The traditional mind-body problem arises because our phenomenal experience is rooted in the representational structure of the conscious mind itself.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent (Inferred). Consciousness is analyzed as an ongoing process arising from complex functional integration of representational events within the brain, consistent with materialist emergence.",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence (Justified). As a materialist, representationalist, and functionalist account, the phenomenal self arises from complex physical (neural/computational) organization and is implicitly reducible in principle, even if subjectively felt as irreducible due to the self-model structure.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (the first-person perspective) is explained as the content of the transparent self-model/EAM. Intentionality (directedness) is inherent in the phenomenal self, but conscious thought often remains non-agentive (lacking veto-control) , .",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (qualitative feel) are accounted for as specific contents within the phenomenal self/self-model, resulting from the functional integration of representational events , .",

    "location_and_distribution": "The location is the representational structure instantiated by conscious minds/brain . Specifically, conscious systems are representational systems and conscious states are representational states .",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Conscious experience has a causal role in the optimization of certain human behaviors . It is necessary for optimizing flexible intrapersonal interactions and for the emergence of cumulative culture .",
