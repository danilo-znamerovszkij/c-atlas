    "summary": "This theory models consciousness as the emergent and adaptive output of the brain, which is viewed as a dynamic network of complex, non-linear interactions. Consciousness embodies characteristics inherent to complex adaptive systems (CAS), such as unpredictability, chaotic dynamics, and self-organizing principles.",
