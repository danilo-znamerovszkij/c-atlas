    "summary": "This ancient philosophical theory, foundational to Daoism, posits the Dao (Ultimate Reality or Way) as the constant, eternal source of conscious experience and all existence. The Dao gives rise to the phenomenological dynamic of Consciousness, Cognition (the Name), and Form/Thinghood (the Ten Thousand Things), implying that consciousness is the first and last fundamental reality.",
