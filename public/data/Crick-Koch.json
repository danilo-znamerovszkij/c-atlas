    "theory_title": "Crick and Kochâ€™s Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC)",
    "summary": "This theory proposes a scientific agenda to identify the Neural Correlate of Consciousness (NCC), defined as the minimum activities in the brain that are jointly sufficient and necessary for any specific conscious perception or subjective experience. It asserts that consciousness is entirely physical and can be fully reduced to these specific brain activities.",

    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence. Consistent with a reductive materialist position where consciousness, as a product of the biological brain, is in principle explainable by lower-level physical laws, even if the explicit link is currently elusive.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (inner awareness) and phenomenal experience are directly correlated with, or identical to, the identified NCC. Intentionality would similarly be explained by the physical processes constituting the NCC.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (the qualitative feel of experience) are identified with the minimum neural activities (NCC) that are jointly sufficient for specific conscious perception, although the mechanism for this identity remains the central 'hard problem' challenge.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Biological brains, neurons, electrophysiological activity (spikes), neurochemical transmitter flows, and specific recurrent brain circuits.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessed through third-person scientific observation (neurophysiology, brain scans) correlated with first-person reports of conscious experience.",

    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is directly caused by, and is identical to, the NCC activity. NCC mechanisms (spikes, flows, circuits) are seen as constitutive of phenomenal consciousness.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Hypothesized to be achieved by a neural mechanism acting as a 'conductor' (e.g., the claustrum) that coordinates input from various cortical regions to generate integrated conscious percepts.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Focuses on the physical representation and flow of information via electrophysiological and neurochemical signaling within the neural circuitry.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The theory, rooted in Materialism, implicitly assumes consciousness evolved via phylogenetic processes responsible for nervous system development, though this is not the focus of the NCC definition itself.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The primary tension is the 'explanatory gap': identifying a correlation (NCC) does not explain the identity statement of how physical activity (spikes/chemicals) literally generates phenomenal feel (qualia). The failure to identify a 'clear' NCC after decades of research is a practical limitation.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The theory fails to explain the fundamental link between physical mechanisms (neural activity) and subjective experience (phenomenal consciousness). The distinction between correlation and causation remains a criticism.",
