    "theory_title": "van Inwagen’s Christian Materialism and Resurrection of the Dead",
    "summary": "This theory proposes a form of Christian Materialism where the human person is entirely a material entity, thereby rejecting substance dualism on both philosophical and biblical grounds. It argues that personal identity across death is maintained by God preserving a physically and causally continuous 'bare kernel' of the original material body until the final resurrection.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "The conscious person is a material thing that must maintain material and causal continuity to retain personal identity.",
    "ontological_status": "Christian Materialism (a unique physicalist stance that incorporates divine action for identity continuity).",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Identity Theory: the person (including the mind) is identical to a material thing, though the precise mechanism for long-term survival relies on divine preservation.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "The theory focuses on ontological continuity (God's preservation of the material entity) rather than specific neurological emergence mechanisms, but assumes a physicalist/materialist account of consciousness during life.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity and intentionality are properties of the material person/brain, consistent with standard materialist positions, as the theory focuses primarily on post-mortem continuity rather than conscious function during life.",
    "qualia_account": "The theory is primarily concerned with ontological continuity, but implicitly assumes that qualitative experience is an entirely physical phenomenon of the material organism, consistent with its underlying materialist foundation.",
    "ontological_commitments": "The material person/body, atoms, and God's power (to secure material and causal continuity). It rejects non-physical substances like the soul.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible via philosophical reasoning and theological exegesis, particularly focusing on biblical texts concerning death and resurrection.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic constituent is the material body, specifically the part that maintains identity continuity after death, symbolized by the 'gumnos kókkos' (bare kernel or naked grain)."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Personal Identity, Survival Beyond Death, Theological Coherence.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The mechanism by which God preserves a small portion of the original matter (a bare kernel) to ensure material and causal continuity of the person between death and resurrection.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness arises from the complex material organism during life. Its persistence through death is not continuous but secured by God retaining an element of the material substrate.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Located in the physical body/brain during life. Identity continuity is maintained by the preservation of a 'gumnos kókkos' after death.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness and the mental life of the person are causally efficacious within the physical realm, as they are properties of the material entity.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The coherence of consciousness during life is presumed to be achieved through neural processes within the material body, consistent with a materialist framework.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Conscious processing is based on the functional representation and information flow within the material brain.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The emergence of consciousness during life follows biological and evolutionary processes, as upheld by its materialist position.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "The human person is a material thing, rejecting substance dualism.",
      "The traditional dualist understanding of the New Testament resurrection texts is convoluted, favoring a materialist reading.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The theory faces difficulty explaining how omnipotence can reassemble a person whose atoms have fluxed and spread widely (the conundrum of myriad duplicates). Furthermore, the argument against an immortal soul failed to persuade many Christian dualists.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise mechanism by which God preserves the 'gumnos kókkos' and ensures personal identity given the constant flux and scattering of bodily atoms remains an unresolved requirement.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent in reconciling materialism with Christian doctrine, but relies on a mechanism (divine preservation) that introduces a supernatural element to secure material continuity."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "As a materialist theory, consciousness is ultimately a product of complex physical arrangement, meaning AI should, in principle, be able to instantiate consciousness if the required physical substrate is achieved."

      "stance": "Yes (Conditional on Divine Intervention)",
      "rationale": "The theory's primary goal is to provide a mechanism (God preserving a bare kernel) for the material person to achieve biblical resurrection and post-mortem survival."
