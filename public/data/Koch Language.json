    "summary": "This theory asserts that phenomenal consciousness, or basic inner experience, is functionally independent of language capacity. It is supported by clinical cases where language ability is severely impaired or lost, yet fundamental awareness is retained, leading to the conclusion that basic sentience is a widespread property shared with many non-linguistic animals.",

    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Basic subjectivity (sentience) is retained even without language. Language contributes massively to the self as a 'narrative center,' which constitutes higher-order aspects of subjectivity.",

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Basic consciousness is a product of biological processes that evolved independently of human linguistic complexity.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Located in the biological brain; distributed widely across species (e.g., all mammals) regardless of language ability.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Basic consciousness operates independently of language functions. Language's role is primarily to enhance higher-order human functions, such as the sense of self.",

    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information processing related to raw experience does not require symbolic language representation.",

      "Consciousness does not depend on language.",
      "Clinical cases of brain insult demonstrate that consciousness is retained when language is lost.",

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Empirically testable through neuroscientific study of non-linguistic animals and clinical research on brain trauma victims demonstrating persistent awareness despite aphasiac conditions.",
    "critiques_and_challenges": "Although Koch argues against classical views linking language and consciousness, the contemporary scientific consensus already agrees that basic consciousness does not require language.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The theory confirms what consciousness is *not* dependent on (language) but does not provide a positive solution for the hard problem of consciousness (i.e., what phenomenal experience literally is).",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within the Materialist category, particularly for arguments distinguishing basic awareness from complex, language-mediated self-consciousness."

      "stance": "Conditional",
      "rationale": "Since language is not necessary for consciousness, AI's linguistic capability (LLMs) is irrelevant. AI consciousness depends entirely on whether the necessary non-linguistic physical substrate can be replicated in artificial systems."

      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Consistent with its materialist categorization, consciousness is tied to a physical substrate (the brain) and cannot persist after biological death."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Humanistic only",
      "rationale": "Consciousness enables the self to function as a narrative center via language, allowing for human-created meaning, but the underlying material reality suggests no ultimate cosmic purpose."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Conditional",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is decoupled from language, the focus shifts entirely to duplicating the non-linguistic, physical substrate of basic awareness. If this specific non-linguistic neural structure can be duplicated, virtual immortality is possible."
