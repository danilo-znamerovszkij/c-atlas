    "theory_title": "DOPS Theoretical Framework",
    "summary": "This framework, supported by empirical research into phenomena like NDEs and reincarnation, advocates for a transmission or filter model of consciousness, where the brain acts as an interface rather than a producer of consciousness. It systematically challenges conventional physicalism by arguing that consciousness is independent of the organism and potentially foundational to reality.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as a more inclusive and capacious entity (the 'More') that exists independently of the organism, manifesting in everyday experience via a filter mechanism in the brain.",
    "ontological_status": "Objective or Realist Idealism (or Panentheism)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Transmission/Filter model, where the brain serves as a sensorimotor interface that filters or reduces a more comprehensive, independent consciousness, opposing the physicalist 'production' model.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive",
    "emergence_type": "Not applicable; consciousness is fundamentally primitive or universal (Idealist/Panentheistic basis) , with the brain acting as a filter/reducer.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Derived from the interaction between the independent, comprehensive consciousness (the 'More') and the sensorimotor interface (the brain). Specific mechanism details are limited by source material.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualitative experience is inherent to the independent, comprehensive consciousness (Idealist foundation) and is transmitted or filtered by the brain. The irreducible nature of phenomenal consciousness is leveraged to attack physicalism.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Independent, nonphysical consciousness (the 'More'); psychophysical phenomena (psi, survival data) irreducible to physicalism; objective or realist idealism/panentheism as underlying metaphysics.",
    "epistemic_access": "Empirical study of non-standard psychophysical phenomena (NDEs, reincarnation cases) used to challenge physicalism and infer the nature of reality. Also draws on first-person mystical experiences.",

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal (irreducible); Survival; Psi Phenomena; Mystical Experience; Prodigious Memory/Genius.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle of transmission or filtering, where the brain limits the expression of a wider, non-physical consciousness.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is fundamentally existent (primitive). The manifestation of everyday consciousness is dynamically produced through the brain's interaction/filtering processes.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Fundamentally non-local, existing independently of the brain, consistent with Idealism/Panentheism foundations. Everyday consciousness is localized (dependent on brain interaction/filtering).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The brain's functional role is primarily to serve as a sensorimotor interface. The role of the deeper consciousness (the 'More') is to contain capacities and information, sometimes expressed as 'subliminal uprush'.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Likely achieved by the underlying unity of the independent, comprehensive consciousness (consistent with Idealist/Panentheist foundations).",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information and capacities normally confined to the 'More' are brought into everyday consciousness via 'subliminal uprush'.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consistent with 'evolutionary panentheism,' suggesting consciousness or deep reality is prior or fundamental rather than a contingent, purely physical evolutionary product.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Demonstration of postmortem survival rules out most materialism theories.",
      "Experiences during extreme physiological conditions (e.g., NDE during cardiac arrest) challenge the physicalist production model.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The empirical data underlying the theory (psi/survival phenomena) are generally not accepted by mainstream science and are often dismissed as illusion, delusion, or poor methodology.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise form of the adequate theory (Idealism/Panentheism) must respect and incorporate modern physics discoveries. The mechanism of interaction between the 'More' and the brain requires further clarification.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent with non-materialistic worldviews, particularly objective idealism/panentheism. Fundamentally designed to be ontologically incompatible with physicalism by presenting evidence of the mind's irreducibility."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Poor Prospects",
      "rationale": "The framework suggests consciousness is irreducible and tied to fundamental, universal reality (Idealism/Panentheism), thus implying that mere artificial/computational systems are unlikely to possess it, leading to poor prospects for AGI consciousness."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "The theory is motivated by empirical evidence (NDEs, reincarnation cases) arguing that consciousness survives bodily death, thus requiring a non-material production model."
    },
    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Cosmic/Ultimate",
      "rationale": "The core metaphysical tendency toward Idealism/Panentheism suggests that consciousness is grounded in a highest consciousness which provides ultimate meaning, purpose, and value."
    },
    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "No (Not Needed)",
      "rationale": "Since consciousness is non-physical and potentially continuous/surviving death, duplication (virtual immortality) would likely fail to capture the original first-person self or would be irrelevant if genuine survival occurs."
