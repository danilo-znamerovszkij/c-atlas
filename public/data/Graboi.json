    "summary": "This model proposes that consciousness arises from the interaction of 'pure awareness energy' (an absolute, fundamental aspect) with the brain (matter), producing consciousness in the nonphysical mind. It suggests that information from neural activity dissociates into a universal 'pure information' format, available nonlocally to receptive minds, motivated by the reality of nonphysical phenomena like telepathy and clairvoyance.",
