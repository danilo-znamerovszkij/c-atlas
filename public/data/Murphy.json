    "summary": "This theory asserts that consciousness is wholly physical, arising solely from biological brains, yet mental properties or states are considered ontologically distinct and irreducible to underlying physical states . It seeks to provide a philosophically robust, scientifically compatible, and theologically acceptable nondualistic account of the human person .",
