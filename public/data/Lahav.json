    "theory_title": "Lahav's relativistic theory",
    "summary": "This theory characterizes consciousness as a physical phenomenon that is relative to the measurements performed by a 'cognitive frame of reference'. Analogous to velocity in physics, different observers operating in different cognitive frames will manifest different physical properties (conscious awareness for oneself versus measured brain activity for another) when observing the same phenomenon.",

    "mind_body_relationship": "The relationship is relativistic: the same underlying phenomenon is manifested as conscious awareness (from the internal frame) or brain activity (from an external frame) depending on the measurement context. This suggests a frame-dependent identity or correlation.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Not explicitly detailed, but likely Weak Emergence, as it relies on established (or analogous) physical principles (relativity, measurement) rather than postulating new fundamental laws for the existence of consciousness itself.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is inherent in the definition of the 'cognitive frame of reference'; two people, being in different cognitive frames, experience consciousness differently. Intentionality (directedness of thought) is not explicitly addressed in the provided sources.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are implicitly accounted for as subjective physical properties manifested within a specific cognitive frame of reference, although the intrinsic qualitative nature of the experience itself is not detailed.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical reality, physical measurement processes, and a 'cognitive frame of reference' analogized from relativistic physics.",
    "epistemic_access": "Access is frame-dependent: within one's own cognitive frame, conscious awareness is experienced; from a separate cognitive frame, only brain activity can be measured.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The source provides a description, not a critique section. Potential tension lies in translating the analogy of physical relativity (like velocity) into verifiable, non-metaphorical cognitive or neurobiological processes.",
