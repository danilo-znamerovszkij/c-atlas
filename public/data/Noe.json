    "theory_title": "Sensorimotor (Enactive) Theory of Consciousness (Noë’s “Out of Our Heads” View)",
    "summary": "This theory rejects the assumption that consciousness occurs exclusively inside the brain, arguing that internal brain processes alone are insufficient to generate experience. Consciousness is fundamentally an activity or a process enacted through the dynamic, continuous, and skilled interaction between the brain, the body, and the environment.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as the activity of keeping tabs, keeping touch, paying attention to, and interacting with the world. It is the process of accessing and enabling the world to 'show up' for the organism, defined by active engagement.",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind is the activity that is generated by the brain, body, and environment working together. The brain provides the necessary mechanical substrate but is not sufficient for consciousness; it is the locus of the symbols, not the consciousness itself.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (how the world 'shows up for us') and intentionality arise from the organism's active, skillful engagement with the environment, influenced by context, interest, knowledge, and understanding.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are implied to be part of the density, detail, and robustness of real-life experiences that arise from continuous world interaction, which distinguishes true consciousness from mere dream experiences.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical environment, biological brain/body, and the dynamic interaction/activity between them.",
    "epistemic_access": "Access requires looking outside the head to the organism's proactive role and skill acquisition in the world, shifting the focus from internal brain events to external action and interaction.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The dynamic, interconnected system comprising the brain, the body's sensorimotor systems, and the external environment."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Agency, Access (as achievement)",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Active and continuous engagement between the organism and its surroundings. Consciousness is located in this interaction/activity loop, not the internal brain state alone.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic process of keeping touch and interacting with the world, continuously enacted by the organism.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Distributed across the entire system of brain, body, and environment; located 'out of our heads'.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is proactive, enabling the organism to access and enact the world, serving to guide deliberate, contextual, and skillful action for survival and understanding.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved through the coherence of the world 'showing up for us' due to the organism's skillful, active involvement and attending to the world.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is proactively accessed and shaped by the organism's interaction and skills, defining the meaning of the environment.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness arose to enable access to the world and mediate meaning through embodied and skillful interaction, suggesting a strong adaptive advantage for survival.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Consciousness is the activity of continuous engagement with the world.",
      "The density and robustness of real-life experience (in contrast to dreams) supports the necessity of external interaction.",
      "The brain is the mechanical locus of symbols, but the activity is consciousness itself."

    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The main tension is explaining precisely how the interaction is consciousness in a strong sense, rather than merely enabling or influencing it. Critics reject that studying internal brain events is insufficient for understanding consciousness.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The theory lacks a clear definition of how the external interaction/activity constitutes the inner experience or qualia, and how to rigorously distinguish this activity from mere nonconscious processing.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent within an externalist and embodied philosophical framework, directly challenging the foundational premises of internalist materialism and dualism."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Uncertain/Conditional",
      "rationale": "Standard computation is insufficient; consciousness is possible only if AI systems achieve full embodiment, skills, and continuous, autonomous interaction with a world (meeting the same demands placed on living organisms)."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is inseparable from the continuous, active physical loop involving the brain and body interacting with the world; its cessation means the termination of the conscious activity."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Humanistic only",
      "rationale": "Consciousness enables the agent to acquire context, knowledge, and understanding, granting the capacity to assign meaning to interactions and guide proactive behavior, but implies no transcendent purpose."

      "stance": "Highly Implausible",
