    "summary": "This theory posits that reality consists of two distinct ontological categories: a physical brain and a separate, nonphysical substance (mind/soul).\nThe core explanatory claim is that these two substances interact causally, meaning the nonphysical mind can influence the physical body, and vice versa.",

    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity resides in the separate nonphysical substance (mind/soul), which is intrinsically first-person. Intentionality is conceived as a core, irreducible mental property.",

    "ontological_commitments": "Physical substances (brain/matter) and a separate, nonphysical substance (mind/soul/spirit).",

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Static property (of the nonphysical substance), though the interaction between the physical and nonphysical is dynamic and ongoing.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The physical component (brain) is located in space; the nonphysical component (mind/soul) is separate or independent, sometimes conceived as non-extended.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness (the nonphysical mind) exerts causal force on the physical brain/body and is causally affected by it, enabling conscious control and agency.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is likely ascribed to the simple, indivisible, and fundamentally unified nature of the nonphysical mental substance, rather than a physical process.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information flow involves two-way communication between the physical (brain state) and the nonphysical (mental state) spheres.",
    "evolutionary_account": "No, consciousness is explained by the fundamental existence or creation of the nonphysical component, not through traditional materialistic phylogenetic evolution.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Consciousness requires a separate, nonphysical substance in addition to the physical brain.",
      "Mental states exert causal influence on physical states (mental causation).",
      "The perceived interaction problem is often founded on outdated assumptions of 19th-century billiard-ball physics."

    "testability_status": "Highly speculative/Difficult to test empirically",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The chief criticism is the 'vexing problem' of mental causation, specifically identifying a conceivable mechanism by which nonphysical stuff affects physical stuff. It also faces tensions regarding the physical law of conservation of energy and the causal closure of the physical realm.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The core limitation is providing a coherent explanation of the interaction mechanism, particularly concerning potential violations of physical laws or the problem of overdetermination.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly inconsistent with contemporary scientific materialism, as it requires postulating two distinct ontological categories and violating the causal closure of the physical world."
