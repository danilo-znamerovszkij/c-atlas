    "summary": "Micropsychism is the traditional form of panpsychism holding that phenomenal consciousness, or proto-phenomenal properties, exist as primitive features of all physical ultimates, such as fundamental particles or fields. This means that all facts regarding panpsychism are generated at the micro-level.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "The essence of mentality, awareness, or experience is a primitive, non-reducible feature inherent in every part or aspect of physical reality.",
    "ontological_status": "Panpsychism (often constitutive, anchoring mentality/proto-mentality at the fundamental level of physical reality).",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness is located at the micro-level of physical reality, co-fundamental with the deepest laws of physics, and underlies physical reality itself.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive or fundamental, as consciousness or proto-consciousness is posited to exist at the irreducible base level of reality.",
    "emergence_type": "The macroexperience may be non-emergent (constitutive, simply grounded in microexperience) or strongly emergent from microexperience (nonconstitutive), depending on the specific variant of micropsychism adopted.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "The model assumes the existence of subjective microexperience. Subjective human consciousness arises when these minuscule conscious subjects coalesce.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (phenomenal properties) are inherent phenomenal or proto-phenomenal properties possessed by microphysical ultimates.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical ultimates (fundamental fields and particles) which possess phenomenal or proto-phenomenal properties.",
    "epistemic_access": "Access is generally speculative, as the intrinsic nature of microexperience is conceptually very different from human experience. Knowledge relies on philosophical extension from observable macroexperience.",

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "The dynamics involve the combination or aggregation of micro-level entities to constitute higher-level experiences, the details of which remain complex.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Ubiquitous, distributed across all physical reality everywhere there is energy-matter, associated with fundamental physics.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is a primitive feature of reality. In constitutive variants, microexperience grounds and causes macroexperience.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration must occur through the combination of minuscule conscious subjects, although determining how this happens is the unsolved combination problem.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Consciousness is rooted in intrinsic proto-phenomenal properties rather than purely informational computation.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness is a fundamental feature of reality present 'all along', although its evolution to complex macroscopic forms is subject to natural selection and combination rules.",

      "Phenomenal consciousness is a primitive, non-reducible feature of microphysical ultimates.",

    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": [],
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The main challenge is the 'combination problem': explaining how innumerable simple micro-level subjects of experience can combine or coalesce to form a single macroscopic subject with complex, unified consciousness.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The primary unresolved issue is the combination problem. It is also unclear how the microphysical structure described by physics relates precisely to the phenomenal properties it is claimed to possess.",
    "ontological_coherence": "It is coherent in that it takes consciousness seriously and offers theoretical advantages over traditional dualism (by avoiding physical-nonphysical causal problems) and materialism (by solving the hard problem)."

    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Probably",

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Unlikely",
      "rationale": "While micro-consciousness is fundamental and persists, the persistence of complex individual human consciousness requires the macro-structure (the brain) to dissolve in a way that preserves the coherent aggregate, which is not guaranteed by the theory."
    },
    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Possible",
      "rationale": "Anchoring consciousness fundamentally in physical reality suggests a deeper, ultimate dimension of existence, which potentially entails meaning or purpose absent in strict materialism."

      "stance": "Probably",
      "rationale": "Virtual immortality should be attainable if the precise way micropsychic elements combine to create unique complex consciousness can be successfully duplicated and manipulated by advanced technology."
