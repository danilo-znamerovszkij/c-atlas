    "summary": "This perspective holds that consciousness is a complex emergent property arising solely from biological mechanisms, inextricably linked to the physical rules of the universe. Its main philosophical commitment is hard incompatibilism, affirming biological determinism and consequently denying the existence of free will.",

    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence (Inferred): Though described as a 'complex emergent property' whose nature is challenging to grasp, its grounding in strict biological determinism implies that the emergence must, in principle, conform entirely to physical laws.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (what consciousness is) is acknowledged as existing but stated to be poorly understood and difficult to define. Intentionality and agency (free will) are explicitly rejected as incompatible with determinism.",
    "qualia_account": "Unexplained: The qualitative feel of experience is acknowledged but is deemed beyond current neurobiological understanding, described ambiguously as a 'complex emergent property' that 'explains everything and nothing'.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Biological organisms, neurological structures, and the physical rules of the universe.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible via observation of neurological states; however, the understanding of phenomenal consciousness at the neurobiological level is admitted to be severely limited.",

    "location_and_distribution": "Localized entirely in the brain and biological organism.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Sapolsky admits that the definition of consciousness is confusing and relies on the ambiguous term 'complex emergent property'. Externally, the denial of free will (hard incompatibilism) is a highly controversial philosophical position.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise nature and definition of phenomenal consciousness remain beyond the author's ability to understand or explain fully.",
