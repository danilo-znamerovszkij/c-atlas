    "summary": "Anomalous Monism posits that every mental event is identical to a physical event (token identity), maintaining a monistic ontology. However, the theory insists that there are no strict, exceptionless natural laws connecting mental concepts (types) with physical concepts, leading to the irreducibility of psychology to physics. This dual assertion resolves the apparent conflict between mental causation and the causal completeness of the physical world.",
