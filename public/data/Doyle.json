    "summary": "The ERR theory posits consciousness as an information model, where the mind consists of immaterial information (like software). It works by playing back past experiences—including sensory details and emotion—when current perceptions resemble them, providing crucial survival value to the organism.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as immaterial information, which is recorded and reproduced (re-presented) by structured neural assemblies in the brain. The treatment of information is said to link the physical and the phenomenal in a \"double realization.\"",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism (Information-based). The theory is classified under Materialism but posits information itself might be fundamental, suggesting an informational monist or dual-aspect view rooted in a physical substrate.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Information stored in 'wired together' physical neurons realizes both phenomenal states and information states, suggesting an intrinsic connection or 'double life' where information bridges the physical and the phenomenal.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence. Consciousness arises from the complex organization and processing of information within neural structures, rather than being a fundamental ingredient of reality.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Intentionality (meaning) is evoked by the reproduction of past experiences that resemble current perception, which guides the organism’s appropriate reaction. Subjectivity is inherent in the 're-presentation' of the original first-person experience and accompanying emotion.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are accounted for as the components of the original experience (sensory qualities and emotion) that are bound together during initial storage and reproduced (re-presented) during playback, rather than being assembled algorithmically.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Immaterial information; neural assemblies (wired together neurons); information structures (in the brain).",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible via modeling the information processing architecture and observing behavioral reactions to information (defining 'information consciousness').",

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Unity of Experience (Binding), Memory, Adaptive Behavior.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The Experience Recorder and Reproducer (ERR) mechanism, which dictates that a minimal primitive mind needs only to 'play back' past, stored experiences (rather than retrieving representations) when stimulated by similar current experiences.",

    "location_and_distribution": "Localized in information structures within the brain (neural assemblies) that record and reproduce experiences.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness provides survival value by allowing the organism to recall past relevant experiences, guiding actions and enabling the entity to react appropriately to environmental information.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The binding problem is solved because all sensory components and accompanying emotional content are bound together during the initial recording and remain bound during reproduction, eliminating the need for algorithmic assembly.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is immaterial, like software. It is stored in brain structures and 're-presented' directly as experience upon stimulation by external perception.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness evolved due to its 'obvious relevance (survival value)' in enabling the organism to retrieve and utilize past experiences when faced with new perceptions.",

      "The mind is immaterial information, distinct from digital information processing.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The main conceptual tension lies in describing the mind as immaterial information while explicitly stating the brain is not processing digital information, requiring a definition of information distinct from conventional computing models.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise nature of the 'double realization' of information—how information connects physical processes and conscious experience—needs detailed explanation to constitute a fundamental theory of consciousness.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent internally as an information model, but its reliance on immaterial information challenges strict reductive materialism, pushing its classification toward the boundary of physicalism."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "Since consciousness is defined functionally in information terms (reacting appropriately to information) and the mind is likened to software, artificial systems should be able to instantiate the necessary information structures to achieve consciousness, provided they can reproduce the complexity of integrated experience."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is tied to the physical realization of information structures within biological neural assemblies; therefore, it ceases upon the dissolution of the body and brain."

      "stance": "Humanistic only",

      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "If the mind is immaterial information (software) recorded in the brain, then perfect duplication of this information structure in a non-biological medium should preserve the first-person mental self."
