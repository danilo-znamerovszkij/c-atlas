    "summary": "This is a purely biological and materialistic theory that posits consciousness arises from complex brain morphology and evolutionary selection. The core mechanism involves the Dynamic Core, defined by ongoing, massive, recursive signaling (reentry) among neuronal groups, especially in the thalamocortical system, enabling high-order discriminations.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as the result of high-order discriminations arising from reentrant interactions in the dynamic core of the thalamocortical system.",

    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is inherent to the activity of the individual organism, reflecting its unique phenotypic properties and life history. Intentionality is reflected in the selectional nature of the system favoring adaptive responses.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are defined as high-order discriminations made possible by underlying neural structure and dynamics. The hard problem of qualia is dismissed as ill posed because a descriptive theory cannot replicate the subjective experience it explains.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Biological brains, neuronal groups, reentrant neural circuitry, and synaptic efficacy changes.",
    "epistemic_access": "Primarily accessed via scientific investigation and third-person description of neuroanatomical structure and neural dynamics, acknowledging that this cannot replicate the first-person experience.",

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Neural Darwinism (Theory of Neuronal Group Selection, TNGS) combined with Dynamic Core organization via reentrant neural circuitry.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic process arising from the integration of many inputs by reentrant interactions, generating a continuing sequence of different metastable states over time.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized predominantly in the thalamocortical circuits (the Dynamic Core).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The functional role is to enable high-order discriminations, leading to adaptive responses. Higher-order consciousness allows for planning and consciousness of being conscious.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Achieved through reentry, which imposes correlations on diverse, interacting neuronal groups, favoring synchronously active circuits across distributed brain areas.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information processing is selectional (Darwinian), relying on the selection of degenerate circuits based on experience, rather than being instructional.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness evolved in two stages: Primary Consciousness arose when perpetual categorization linked via reentry to memory (the 'remembered present'); Higher-Order Consciousness arose later with linguistic performance and conceptual memory.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Consciousness is a purely biological, thoroughly materialistic outcome of evolutionary selection (Neural Darwinism).",
      "The Dynamic Core integrates inputs to generate conscious states through reentrant neural circuitry.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Critics remain unpersuaded that this materialistic framework fully accounts for the subjective, phenomenal existence of qualia, viewing Edelman’s dismissal of the hard problem as insufficient.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The theory cannot, by definition, convey the first-person experience (the 'redness of red') through a third-person scientific description, leaving an experiential gap.",

      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "As a mechanistic biological theory, consciousness should be possible in artificial systems if the selectional and reentrant neural circuitry mechanisms are sufficiently and correctly implemented in non-biological substrates. Proponents suggested designing a conscious artifact is feasible."

      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "Since consciousness is the product of specific physical/structural dynamics and functions (Neural Darwinism/Dynamic Core), a perfect duplication or uploading of these mechanisms into a digital medium would preserve the first-person mental self."
