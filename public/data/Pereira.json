    "theory_title": "Pereira’s Sentience",
    "summary": "This theory posits that consciousness has two distinct modalities: foundational sentience, characterized by basic feelings like pain and hunger, and higher-level cognitive consciousness, involving abstract thinking and representation. The core claim is that cognitive capacity is dependent on this underlying sentient state, which is biologically grounded in homeostatic systems.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is a composite biological system consisting of sentience (correlated with dynamic control of biochemical homeostasis) and cognitive consciousness (correlated with patterns of bioelectrical activity in neural networks).",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism/Naturalism (Inferred from its categorization under Materialism and focus on physiological/neural correlates)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Conscious modalities (sentience and cognition) are functionally dependent on, and have precise physiological correlates within, the biological organism, specifically homeostatic systems and neural networks.",

    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence (Justified by its strict grounding in observable and measurable biological/physiological processes, suggesting it is, in principle, explainable by physical laws, despite complexity.)",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity arises from sentience, the capacity to feel basic sensations (e.g., hunger, pain). Intentionality is present in cognitive consciousness through the elaboration of linguistic and imagery representations.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are accounted for via the foundational modality of sentience, which corresponds directly to the capacity to feel basic, qualitative sensations (e.g., pain, thirst).",

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness arises through a hierarchical relationship where the existence of basic sentience, linked to physiological control, is a necessary base for the emergence of cognitive functioning.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The core correlates are distributed across physiological systems responsible for homeostatic control (for sentience) and neural networks (for cognitive processing).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Sentience serves the vital function of regulating physiological processes to maintain homeostasis and life continuation. It provides the conscious feedback necessary for basic biological regulation.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Unspecified. (Justified by the theory’s focus on the distinction and hierarchical relationship between conscious modalities, rather than the mechanism for unifying sensory inputs.)",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Cognitive consciousness involves the processing and elaboration of linguistic and imagery representations, which occurs in neural networks.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Unspecified in detail, but inferred to be adaptive and evolutionary, linking consciousness modalities to fundamental biological imperatives like survival and maintenance of homeostasis.",

Higher cognition tests may be inadequate for assessing all conscious states.",
