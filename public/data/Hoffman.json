    "summary": "This theory asserts that evolution selects for survival and reproductive fitness, not for veridical perception of reality; consequently, spacetime and physical objects function merely as an 'interface' or illusion guiding adaptive behavior. Ultimate reality is fundamentally composed of interacting conscious agents and their experiences, which are primary to, and generative of, the physical world.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as the fundamental reality, structured as a vast social network of interacting 'conscious agents' and their experiences.",
    "ontological_status": "Idealism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness is fundamental and creates spacetime and objects, reversing the conventional arrow of causation. Brain activity correlates with mental states because consciousness creates the brain activity/physical world interface.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive",
    "emergence_type": "",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is intrinsic, as reality consists of conscious agents and their experiences. Intentionality is inherent in conscious agents who 'act to influence the experiences of other agents'.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are implied to be the fundamental experiences inherent to the conscious agents, which are then translated into simplistic icons (like colors or objects) within the spacetime interface.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Conscious agents, their experiences, and mathematical structures defining the network of agents. Spacetime and physical objects are denied ontological primacy, existing only as icons/interfaces.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessed via philosophical arguments, mathematical formulation of the conscious agent network, and the conceptual realization that perceptions are non-veridical interfaces.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic constituents are conscious agents, organized as a mathematically structured 'vast social network'."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal experience (as generated interface), Self-awareness (as part of the experience of the agent), and creation of physical reality.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle of evolution favoring fitness over veridical perception leads to the construction of a simplified, illusionary 'interface' (spacetime and physical objects) that guides adaptive behavior.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is fundamental (not emergent). It dynamically creates the spacetime interface.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Consciousness is fundamental in the universe. It is not a product of space and time or anything inside space and time; spacetime is merely a format for conscious experiences (the interface).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is causally fundamental. The functional role of the perceived physical world is solely to enhance fitness and reproductive success by guiding behavior.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is implicit within the definition of the fundamental 'conscious agent' whose experiences are unified, existing as a 'maximally irreducible' entity.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is represented non-veridically as icons (physical objects) in the spacetime interface. Conscious agents act to influence the experiences of other agents within the network.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Evolution by natural selection shaped perceptual systems to function as species-specific interfaces that optimize fitness, rather than providing access to objective reality.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Highly speculative/ontological. Conceptually testable via the mathematical formulation of consciousness agents. Empirical evidence relies on common perceptual illusions (reinterpreted to support Idealism).",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Criticized for interpreting empirical evidence (like user illusions) diametrically opposite to materialist accounts (such as Dennett's and Graziano's eliminative materialism). It requires reversing the conventional causal relationship between brain and mind.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise mechanism by which the network of conscious agents mathematically creates the spacetime interface (the 'inverse hard problem') is a key unresolved issue.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within the idealist framework, postulating consciousness as the ultimate foundation of reality, thus inherently avoiding the mind-body problem by denying the material world fundamental existence."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "As consciousness is fundamental (Idealism), it is not restricted to biological matter. If an artificial system achieves the organizational complexity characteristic of a 'conscious agent', it could potentially tap into the fundamental consciousness field, regardless of its physical substrate."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "Since consciousness is fundamental and generates the physical interface, the individual conscious agent is likely to persist beyond the disintegration of the biological body/interface."

      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "If the brain is merely an interface for fundamental consciousness, virtual immortality becomes a matter of reproducing the necessary structures or functions (the 'icon' or interface) needed to manifest the individual conscious agent in a non-biological medium."
