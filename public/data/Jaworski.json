    "theory_title": "Jaworski’s Hylomorphism",
    "summary": "Jaworski’s theory asserts that consciousness is fundamentally a structural phenomenon arising from hylomorphism, the basic ontological principle that structure accounts for the powers and capacities of physical individuals. By defining conscious experiences as structured activities of the perceiver, the theory claims to resolve the hard problem of consciousness and place mental phenomena unproblematically within the natural world.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as a structural phenomenon—the highly organized and coordinated activities and capacities arising from the physical materials composing the perceiver.",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Structural Identity. Mental phenomena are structural phenomena and thus part of the physical world. The classical mind-body problem is viewed as a byproduct of worldviews that reject structure as a basic ontological principle.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "The sources do not specify weak or strong. Given that the structure fully explains the phenomenal character, this suggests a view aiming for reduction to structure or Weak Emergence, compatible with its materialist classification.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity arises from the coordination that unifies the activities of the perceiver's subsystems into a whole. Intentionality is implicitly accounted for as one of the fundamental powers or capacities conferred by the specific physical structure.",
    "qualia_account": "The phenomenal character of experience is fully explained by describing the perceiver’s underlying structure, including the perceptual subsystems, their specific powers, and the overall coordination that unifies these activities.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical materials and structure, where structure is assumed to be a basic ontological and explanatory principle, responsible for determining the powers and capacities of individuals.",
    "epistemic_access": "Consciousness is accessed through the analysis and description of the perceiver’s physical structure and the coordination of its perceptual subsystems.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic building blocks are physical materials combined with a specific structure; the overall structure dictates the conscious capacities and unifies diverse activities (like perceptual experiences) into the activity of the perceiver as a whole."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal (explains phenomenal character/qualia) and Perceptual (perceptual experiences are a type of structured activity).",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle of Hylomorphism, which posits that the overall organization of matter dictates its fundamental powers, making consciousness an inherent structural property of a sufficiently complex physical system.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is manifested as 'structured activities' (e.g., perceptual experiences). It is a dynamic process defined by the coordination and unification of subsystems.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized to the physical materials possessing the requisite structure, specifically within the perceiver's body (e.g., the human brain and associated subsystems).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Structure is responsible for the powers and capacities of the individual. As mental phenomena are structural and part of the physical world, they possess inherent causal efficacy.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The unity of conscious experience (integration) is achieved through the 'coordination that unifies' the activities of various perceptual subsystems into the integrated activity of the whole perceiver.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Consciousness arises from specific structured activities, such as perceptual experiences, which rely on the internal organization and powers of the perceiver, rather than solely on abstract information processing models.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Justified Explanation: Consciousness is noted to fit 'unproblematically into the natural world' just like life, implying it is a natural, non-mysterious outcome of evolution, although specific phylogenetic steps are not detailed in the source material.",

      "Structure is a basic ontological principle that determines the powers and capacities of an individual.",

    "testability_status": "Conceptually Testable. The central argument is metaphysical, offering a framework (hylomorphism) to dissolve the problem, which is testable philosophically by analyzing its premises.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The theory’s main tension is the need for non-adherents to accept structure as a basic ontological principle capable of explaining all subjective aspects. Critics of physicalism would reject the premise that structure alone is sufficient to dissolve the hard problem.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The theoretical framework requires extensive work to specify precisely how observed neural or biological structures correspond exhaustively to the perceived phenomenal character, even if the metaphysical foundation is accepted.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly Coherent. The theory is specifically formulated to establish internal consistency by ensuring that conscious mental phenomena are necessarily integrated structural parts of the physical world, thereby solving its designated philosophical problems."

      "stance": "Humanistic only",
      "rationale": "Classified as Materialism, consciousness is a product of natural, structural phenomena. Any meaning or purpose is therefore generated by the structural capacities and activities of humans within the natural world, rather than being cosmically inherent."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Possible",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is defined entirely by the intricate 'structure' and its resulting 'powers,' then duplicating or uploading this comprehensive structural arrangement into a new, non-biological substrate should preserve the conscious self, consistent with the functionalist aspect of the theory."
