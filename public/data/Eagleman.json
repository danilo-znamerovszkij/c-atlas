    "summary": "This perspective advocates for intellectual openness (Possibilianism) regarding consciousness, rejecting rigid metaphysical dogmas. Mechanistically, it views consciousness as a highly abstract, high-level representation (akin to a CEO) that filters massive underlying neural processes, serving primarily to monitor goal success and intervene during surprising events. The theory emphasizes that while the mind is integrally dependent on the brain, the nature of subjective experience (qualia) remains a profound, perhaps conceptually insoluble, mystery.",

    "mind_body_relationship": "Integral Dependence. Consciousness is integrally dependent on the brain, as demonstrated by the effects of brain damage, but the dependence relationship is explicitly left as an open question (i.e., necessity vs. sufficiency).",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent/Uncertain. Consciousness is described as riding on top of complex machinery, implying emergence, though the subjective 'feel' is considered an unsolved mystery that might challenge pure emergence.",
    "emergence_type": "Uncertain. While the observed correlation implies emergence from physical processes, the inability to explain how the qualitative feel arises conceptually suggests the possible necessity of non-material factors if materialism is insufficient.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (the 'feel') is acknowledged as the central mystery that current science and mathematics cannot explain. Intentionality is implicitly handled by the high-level abstract representations related to monitoring goal states (e.g., success/failure).",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (the inner experience) are recognized as fundamentally mysterious, lacking any current theoretical explanation. The inability to conceptually bridge physical processes and qualitative experience is highlighted as a critical limitation for all current theories.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Commits to the existence of a massive neural substrate and high-level abstract representations. Due to the mystery of qualia, it maintains intellectual openness regarding the possibility of additional, currently unknown, physical or non-physical elements.",

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic process arising from successive levels of abstraction within the brain, focusing on efficient processing rather than raw data integration.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized in the brain, with activity riding 'on top of a massive amount of machinery,' suggesting dependence on highly organized neural systems.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness enables high-level decision-making, planning, and monitoring of goal fulfillment (e.g., success or failure), serving an adaptive function by focusing resources when outcomes are uncertain or surprising.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration occurs through the creation of highly abstract, high-level representations, synthesizing massive amounts of underlying activity into cohesive, simple summaries.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is heavily filtered and abstracted into high-level representations, reducing the 'lightning storm of neural activity' into simple, functional summaries.",
