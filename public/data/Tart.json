    "theory_title": "Tart’s Emergent Interactionism",
    "summary": "This is a dualistic theory claiming that consciousness is an emergent 'system property' resulting from the interaction between the physical 'B system' (brain and body) and the non-physical 'M/L system' (mental and life aspects of reality). The theory is rooted in the study of altered states and parapsychology, which Tart argues demonstrates the inadequacy of purely materialistic views.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is a 'system property' that emerges from the auto-psi interaction between the physical B system (brain and body) and the non-physical M/L system (mental and life aspects of reality).",
    "ontological_status": "Dualism, specifically described as 'emergent interactionism substance dualism' or 'pragmatic dualism'.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Interactionist. The mental/life aspects (M/L system) interact with the brain and body (B system) to produce consciousness.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent.",
    "emergence_type": "The theory implies a form of strong emergence, as the resulting system property is not reducible to the physical B system alone, relying critically on the non-physical M/L system and psychophysical interaction.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is inherent to the mental/life aspects (M/L system) of reality. The emergent system property (consciousness) possesses a first-person perspective, implied by Tart's focus on subjective experiences like altered states.",
    "qualia_account": "The qualitative feel is housed within the non-physical M/L system, which handles the mental and life aspects of reality.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Two fundamentally different kinds of entities: a physical substance (B system: brain and body governed by physical law) and a separate non-physical substance (M/L system: mental and life aspects of reality).",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible through conventional neuroscience (for the B system) and, crucially, through the objective verification of psi/paranormal phenomena, which provide evidence against materialistic views, as well as through introspection into altered states.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The structure consists of the B system (physical) and the M/L system (non-physical). Consciousness is the dynamic, emergent system property arising from their auto-psi interaction."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal consciousness, Altered States of Consciousness, Agency (as implied by interactionism), Psi phenomena.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The auto-psi interaction between the physical B system and the non-physical M/L system, which generates consciousness as a system property.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic, emergent system property. When psi abilities are used, consciousness exhibits non-local properties, demonstrating temporal and spatial mobility beyond the physical constraints of the body/brain.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The physical component is localized in the brain/body (B system). The non-physical M/L system is associated with the mental and life aspects of reality and can be non-local when engaged in psi.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness (via the M/L system) possesses causal power, as its reality is demonstrated by psi phenomena challenging the causal closure of the physical world.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is implicit in the definition of consciousness as a unified 'system property' resulting from the interaction of the two primary systems.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information processing is implied through the functions of the M/L system (mental/life aspects), especially its capacity to pick up non-local information during psi-engaged states.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The B system (body and brain) is subject to physical laws. The M/L system is related to life/mental aspects. Consciousness emerges from their interaction, suggesting an evolutionary link between biological complexity and the capacity for interaction with the non-physical M/L system.",

    ],
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The theory's reliance on psi phenomena and the rejection of the psychoneural identity hypothesis places it outside mainstream physicalist science. As a dualism, it faces the classical problem of explaining how the non-physical M/L system causally interacts with the physical B system.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise mechanism of the 'auto-psi interaction' is unclear, and Tart acknowledges that if personal identity survives death, it might be fundamentally different from the original person.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent within its own Dualistic framework, but fundamentally incompatible with Materialist or Physicalist ontologies due to the reliance on non-physical entities and the causal efficacy of psi phenomena."

      "stance": "Unlikely",
      "rationale": "If consciousness requires the radically separate, non-physical M/L system, non-biological intelligences based only on the physical B system could not achieve true inner awareness, unless unknown psychophysical laws automatically generated the M/L component based on physical complexity (Emergent Dualism exception)."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "As a form of substance dualism, consciousness requires a separate, non-physical M/L system which could potentially maintain existence after the dissolution of the physical brain and body. Anomalous and Altered States theories generally favor survival."
