    "theory_title": "Hiller’s eternal discarnate consciousness",
    "summary": "This theory posits that consciousness is an eternal discarnate soul, or 'spirit,' that is hard attached to the physical body during life but functions freely in a Universal Field of Consciousness (UFC) when released. The UFC is characterized as the mind of God, and the soul is believed to bring moral values to the physical being.",

    "mind_body_relationship": "Interactionist Dualism. The consciousness (soul) is 'hard attached' to the body during life and brings nonphysical components (moral values) to influence the physical brain/body.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive/Fundamental. The soul is described as eternal, existing before and after physical life, and its ultimate ground (UFC) is fundamental.",
    "emergence_type": "",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is inherent to the eternal soul. In the discarnate state, thought and movement become instantaneous, suggesting immediate intentionality beyond physical constraints.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are radically enhanced and nonphysical, intrinsic to the discarnate consciousness. For instance, visual perception is 360°, everything appears to be made of light, and the world experienced is multidimensional.",

    "location_and_distribution": "Nonlocal/Universal. The soul/spirit functions in the Universal Field of Consciousness (UFC), which is nonlocal and multidimensional.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The functional role of the soul is to bring moral values from the UFC to the body. When discarnate, consciousness causes instantaneous movement through thought, and telepathic connection with other souls is possible.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The unification of experience is intrinsic to the nature of the consciousness itself, which is connected to the ultimate unity of the Universal Field (Mind of God).",

      "Verification studies of OBE reports (checking accuracy of observations made while supposedly discarnate) "

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The theory relies heavily on interpreting anomalous experiences (OBEs/NDEs) as veridical evidence of nonphysical survival. Such phenomena are difficult to explain in conventional physicalist terms and often dismissed by mainstream science.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The connection between quantum mechanics (specifically entanglement) and discarnate consciousness remains a highly speculative analogy. The core concepts (soul, UFC) are fundamentally metaphysical.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent within nonphysical/Idealist frameworks. Directly challenges Materialism Theories by postulating an eternal, nonphysical component necessary for consciousness."
