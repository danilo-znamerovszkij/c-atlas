    "summary": "William Hirstein argues that the primary obstacle preventing a straightforward physical explanation of the conscious mind is the unfounded 'assumption of privacy'. By removing this metaphysical assumption—the idea that one person can never experience another’s conscious states—the motivation for creating vexing dualisms, panpsychisms, and theories claiming insolubility is undermined.",

    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is conceived as fully compatible with physicalist explanation once the 'assumption of privacy'—which creates the illusion of metaphysical distance—is rejected.",
    "qualia_account": "The qualitative feel of consciousness is fundamentally accounted for within a physicalist explanation, once the conceptual need for non-physical explanations (driven by the privacy assumption) is dissolved.",

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal consciousness (The focus is on explaining the nature of the conscious mind in terms that refute non-physicalist theories, which often focus on qualia and subjectivity).",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The rejection or undermining of the conceptual 'assumption of privacy' is the core explanatory principle, allowing the conscious mind to be solved by standard physical explanation.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The main criticism would likely focus on whether simply identifying the 'assumption of privacy' as the error actually suffices to close the explanatory gap and deliver a complete, detailed physical explanation of consciousness.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The theory must ultimately present the detailed positive physical description that explains consciousness (e.g., specific neural correlates or mechanisms) once the philosophical obstacle is removed.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent with physicalist and materialist ontological frameworks, as its goal is explicitly to demonstrate the sufficiency of physical explanations."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Likely",

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "The theory is a Materialist model aiming to defeat dualisms. Materialism holds that consciousness is solely a product of the biological brain, meaning it ceases upon biological death."
