    "theory_title": "Friston’s free-energy principle and active inference",
    "summary": "This theory conceptualizes consciousness as a natural process arising from the minimization of 'free energy,' which is the difference between an organism's internal model (perceptual expectations) and real-time sensory inputs. Consciousness, therefore, functions as the evolved mechanism for simulating scenarios of the world and reducing prediction error to ensure survival and maintain homeostasis.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as a natural process of inference, specifically the internal emergent model that monitors and minimizes the free energy principle (surprise), thereby optimizing the representational capacities of physical/brain systems.",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism; often referred to as Markovian Monism, which views mind/matter distinction as dialectical rather than ontological.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Monistic/Identity. The theory proposes that consciousness is the natural outcome of the physical/brain system's self-organizing processes, dissolving familiar dialectics between mind and matter.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence. Consciousness is seen as nothing more and nothing less than a natural process (like evolution or weather) arising from complex, self-organizing physical systems.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (first-person perspective) is framed by the informational geometry induced when a system's internal states can be distinguished from external states (Markovian Monism). Intentionality is reflected in the active inference process, which involves inferring the causes of sensory states and navigating the world.",
    "qualia_account": "The theory is highly deflationary regarding the Hard Problem, treating consciousness as a process to be understood rather than a 'thing' whose qualitative attributes need definition. Qualia, if acknowledged, would be epiphenomena or aspects of the internal generative model required for inference.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical/brain systems, complex self-organizing systems, intrinsic and extrinsic information geometries, and the concept of inference/process.",
    "epistemic_access": "Consciousness is known and studied through the mathematical formalization of the free-energy principle, allowing for objective analysis of the processes that give rise to the notion of consciousness.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "Internal generative models (predictive processing hierarchy) that operate based on dynamic equilibrium and attractors in self-organizing systems."

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The Free-Energy Principle (FEP), which states that all self-organizing systems must minimize free energy (or 'surprise'), driving action and perception through active inference.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Dynamic process. Consciousness emerges when self-evidencing (the process of systems achieving stability via attractors) gains 'temporal thickness' or 'counterfactual depth,' allowing inferences about future actions.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized in the physical brain system; cortical responses are seen as the brain’s attempt to minimize free energy.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness serves an adaptive and functional role as the evolved mechanism for simulating scenarios, monitoring, and minimizing free energy to promote survival (homeostasis) and navigate the world.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is implicit in the construction of a single internal emergent model that predicts the external world and minimizes global surprise/prediction error.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information processing is structured around prediction, where internal models (perceptual expectations) are compared against sensory input, and learning relies on minimizing the brain's free energy.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness is an evolved mechanism arising from the fundamental biological imperative to minimize prediction error and regulate bodily physiology (survival).",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Criticized for being highly deflationary and difficult to reconcile with the first-person reality of phenomenal experience (the Hard Problem), viewing consciousness merely as a mathematical process or 'natural outcome.' Friston finds engaging with the philosophical premise of consciousness as a 'thing' difficult.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The theory faces the challenge of explaining how a natural process of inference minimization gives rise to the *notion* or *illusion* that subjective experience exists, without defining consciousness as a 'thing.'",
    "ontological_coherence": "High. The theory is internally coherent, utilizing Markovian Monism to integrate mental processes and physical matter into a unified, descriptive framework."

      "rationale": "As a strong materialist theory, if consciousness is fully explained by computational processes of inference and representation minimization, then non-biological systems capable of executing these processes must eventually attain consciousness in principle."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is an emergent natural process tied directly to the functional dynamics and physical substrate of the biological brain; thus, it cannot survive bodily decay."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Humanistic only",
      "rationale": "The foundational imperative of the conscious process is survival (minimizing surprise/maintaining homeostasis). The theory does not rationalize ultimate cosmic meaning or purpose, aligning with general materialist perspectives."
    },
    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "Since consciousness is understood as an emergent, formalized process of inference optimization, perfect duplication of the brain's information processing and representational dynamics in a non-biological medium should be sufficient for the continuation of the mental self."
