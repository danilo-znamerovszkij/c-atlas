    "summary": "This hypothesis proposes that the entropy of spontaneous brain activity indexes the informational richness of conscious states, within specific upper and lower bounds. It argues that primary or psychedelic conscious states are associated with elevated entropy and high brain 'criticality,' while normal waking consciousness involves suppressed entropy and operates just below criticality.",

    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "The theory focuses on the system dynamics (entropy) corresponding to different conscious states; subjectivity and intentionality are indirectly addressed via metacognitive functions (like self-awareness and reality-testing) which are enabled by suppressed entropy in normal waking consciousness.",
    "qualia_account": "The theory does not explicitly detail how qualitative feel arises. It posits that entropy indexes the 'informational richness' of conscious states, which implies a link to experience, but does not explain the nature of that subjective quality itself.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Spontaneous brain activity, entropy, criticality, and organized neural networks, particularly the Default-Mode Network (DMN), are committed entities.",
    "epistemic_access": "Consciousness is accessed and characterized via objective calculation of brain entropy from neuroimaging data (e.g., neurodynamics observed during psychedelic states).",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The structure of consciousness is based on the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form and fragment across time, and the level of organization within the Default-Mode Network (DMN)."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal (indexed via informational richness), Primary/Primitive States, Normal Waking Consciousness, Self-awareness (as constrained by suppressed entropy).",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle that the informational richness of conscious states is governed by the entropy of spontaneous brain activity, and the resultant proximity of the brain to a 'critical' point between order and disorder.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic process where fluctuations in entropy dictate the state's character. Suppressed entropy maintains the constrained, stable quality of normal waking consciousness, while elevated entropy leads to critical/primary states.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized primarily in dynamic functional connectivity patterns across the brain, with a specific focus on the highly organized activity within the Default-Mode Network (DMN).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Entropy suppression functions to furnish normal waking consciousness with a constrained quality, enabling metacognitive functions like reality-testing and self-awareness.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is inferred through the complexity and richness indexed by entropy; high entropy states exhibit a greater repertoire of connectivity motifs, suggesting a dynamic form of functional integration.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Entropy serves as an index of informational richness. Integration with the Free-Energy Principle suggests that psychedelics' entropic effect relaxes high-level priors/beliefs, liberating bottom-up information flow.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The model suggests that primary states of consciousness (high entropy) are primitive or preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness (suppressed entropy).",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The theory is criticized by some for using concepts like 'complexity' or 'diversity' interchangeably with consciousness/experience, interpreting them as merely 'brain noise' that fails to explain subjective richness, particularly when reduced brain activity correlates with rich psychedelic experiences.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The theory, rooted in materialism, shares the limitation of explaining *why* a quantitative measure like entropy translates into qualitative subjective experience, although it uses entropy to index the richness of that experience.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly consistent with a physicalist ontology, utilizing quantifiable neurobiological metrics (entropy, criticality) to map different states of consciousness."

      "stance": "Humanistic only",
      "rationale": "As a Materialist, neurobiological explanation for states of consciousness and their metacognitive functions, the theory does not introduce or require a non-physical source of ultimate, cosmic meaning or purpose."

      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is wholly explained by the specific patterns and dynamic parameters of brain activity (like entropy and criticality), then a perfect reproduction of these patterns in a non-biological medium should preserve first-person phenomenal self, supporting virtual immortality."
