    "theory_title": "Panprotopsychism",
    "summary": "Panprotopsychism is a variant of Panpsychism that holds that the fundamental physical entities possess properties that are not conscious themselves but are 'protophenomenal'. These protophenomenal properties must combine in complex structures (like brains) to generate emergent phenomenal consciousness.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as emergent macroexperience resulting from the combination and complexification of fundamental, non-conscious protophenomenal properties.",
    "ontological_status": "Emergent Panpsychism (often classified under Russellian Monism)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind (phenomenal consciousness) is strongly or weakly emergent from the physical substrate, whose intrinsic nature consists of protophenomenal properties. This linkage aims to avoid the causal issues of traditional dualism.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent (Phenomenal consciousness is emergent, but its underlying properties are primitive/fundamental)",
    "emergence_type": "Can be Weak or Strong Emergence, depending on whether the phenomenal properties are deducible, even in principle, from the non-conscious protophenomenal facts.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity arises only at the complex macroscopic level when protophenomenal elements combine. The fundamental properties themselves are unexperienced or 'thin unexperienced qualities'.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (phenomenal properties) are generated by the combination of fundamental protophenomenal properties, transitioning from 'thin unexperienced qualities' to experienced qualities.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Protophenomenal properties (the categorical basis of physical entities), fundamental physical fields, and the emergent phenomenal properties.",
    "epistemic_access": "Primarily philosophical deduction (solving the hard problem by positing hidden intrinsic properties of matter) and conceptual analysis, rather than empirical observation.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "Fundamental physical entities possessing protophenomenal properties that organize into complex macro-structures (e.g., brains) capable of generating consciousness."

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The crucial but currently unknown combination mechanism necessary to transform non-conscious protophenomenal elements into unified, complex conscious experience.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness arises dynamically upon achieving a certain level of complex structural combination of the fundamental protophenomenal properties.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Protophenomenal properties are ubiquitous in fundamental physical entities; phenomenal consciousness is localized in complex biological systems (e.g., brains) capable of combining them.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The emergent phenomenal consciousness typically possesses causal efficacy, inheriting its causal role through its grounding in the intrinsic (protophenomenal) nature of physical reality. This grants a functional role (e.g., adaptive survival advantage) for consciousness.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Requires a solution to the 'combination problem': explaining how non-conscious protophenomenal elements integrate to form a unified subjective macroexperience.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Involves the transformation of underlying protophenomenal properties (which are the categorical basis of physical structure and relational dispositions) into a macro-level structure experienced as phenomenal content.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The combination mechanism is presumed to have evolved in complex biological systems (like animal nervous systems) to confer adaptive advantage through emergent consciousness.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Consciousness is grounded in fundamental, non-conscious protophenomenal properties of micro-level entities.",
      "The theory avoids the physical gap of materialism by positing intrinsic mental properties of matter.",
      "The combination problem remains the chief conceptual challenge for the viability of the theory."

    "testability_status": "Highly speculative/Conceptually testable. Deals with fundamental properties generally inaccessible to current empirical science.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The primary tension is the 'combination problem': explaining how non-conscious fundamental properties cohere to yield complex, subjective consciousness. Critics argue that introducing proto-consciousness merely postpones the hard problem.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise nature of the combination mechanism remains an open question, and determining whether the resulting consciousness is strongly or weakly emergent is unresolved.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Intended to be a coherent middle ground between materialism and dualism, grounding mentality in the intrinsic nature of reality while allowing for emergence at macroscopic scales."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Probably",
      "rationale": "If the consciousness results from a combination mechanism of fundamental properties, then artificial systems built from physical materials possessing these properties could become conscious, provided the necessary combination structure can be engineered."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Unlikely (Long shot)",
      "rationale": "Phenomenal consciousness is tied to the emergent complex structure (e.g., the brain); when this structure dissolves at death, the complex consciousness disappears, leaving only persistent non-conscious protophenomenal substrate."
    },
    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Possible",
      "rationale": "As a variety of panpsychism, it posits a fundamental mental aspect to reality, suggesting possibilities for cosmic meaning or value beyond strictly materialist accounts."

      "stance": "Probably",
      "rationale": "If the rules for combining the ubiquitous protophenomenal properties into a phenomenal self can be understood and perfectly duplicated in a non-biological substrate, virtual immortality should be attainable."
