    "summary": "This theory proposes that consciousness emerges from the vital process of reorganization necessary to adaptively modify control systems. This modification aims to reduce error in intrinsic mechanisms that govern essential, mostly physiological, variables. Consciousness encompasses primary (phenomenal), secondary (access), and tertiary (self-awareness) aspects, linked to hierarchical control functions.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Primary (phenomenal) consciousness is identified as emerging directly from the process of reorganization required for adaptive modification of control systems that minimize error in intrinsic physiological systems.",

    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence. Based on its classification under Materialism, the fundamental processes governing consciousness (reorganization, error reduction) are assumed to be explainable in principle by underlying physical laws.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity arises implicitly from the control of hierarchically organized perceptual variables. Intentionality is addressed via 'purposiveness,' which is the control exerted over these perceptual variables to achieve a goal (reference value).",

    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic structure is a system of hierarchically organized perceptual variables regulated by outputs designed to counteract disturbances and reduce the error between current value and goal state."

    "location_and_distribution": "Systemic. Consciousness arises from the reorganization dynamics across the hierarchical control systems of the organism (brain/body).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness has the functional role of adaptive modification and error reduction. Tertiary consciousness (self-awareness) provides reflection and learning via symbolic systems.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is a process actively managed and controlled by secondary consciousness, specifically through managing the rate of integration of novel information.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Tertiary (self-awareness) consciousness associates internally sustained perceptual information with symbols (language, logic) to form a propositional system for reflection.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Likely faces the challenge of explaining how a purely functional, error-reducing process (reorganization) fully accounts for the qualitative feel (qualia) of primary consciousness, a common criticism levied against functionalist and computational theories.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise physical implementation of the reorganization mechanism and the explicit link between physiological error reduction and the subjective emergence of phenomenal experience (qualia) are implicit rather than fully specified.",
