    "theory_title": "Composite Theory",
    "summary": "This theory, classified under Dualisms, generally posits that the human person is a composite entity made of two distinct yet intimately unified elements, typically an immaterial soul/form and a material body. It seeks to avoid the radical separation of Cartesian dualism while maintaining the irreducibility of consciousness, arguing that the soul acts as the substantial form of the body.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as the activity or function of the composite entity (the ensouled body), arising from the non-material form (soul) realized in the material components. (Inferred based on classification under Dualisms and proximity to Thomistic Dualism in the sources )",
    "ontological_status": "Dualism (Composite/Hylomorphic)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "The mind (soul) is the substantial form of the body, creating a unified composite. This relationship is intimate and non-Cartesian, where the form is necessary to make the living body what it is.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive (The soul/form is fundamental to the composition of the person, which is the conscious entity.)",
    "emergence_type": "The theory focuses on the structural unity of the composite substance rather than emergence in the reductive physicalist sense. The immaterial form is an irreducible principle of organization.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity resides in the irreducible first-person nature of the soul/form, which is indivisibly unified, allowing for determinate, intentional thought contents.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are accounted for as the qualitative features arising from the activity of the unified soul-body composite, which cannot be reduced to purely quantitative physical descriptions.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Immaterial soul/form; material body; a single, unified composite entity (the person).",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible through both third-person observation of the physical body's processes and necessary first-person introspection of the mental activities/form.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "A single, unified substance (the person) composed of two fundamentally different, yet integrated, principles: an immaterial/configurational soul (form) and material components (body)."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Self-awareness, Agency (as activity of the unified composite entity).",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The soul/form acts as the organizing principle (form) that actualizes the capacities of the material body, resulting in conscious activity [Inferred from related concepts in 7.5 ].",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is understood as a dynamic activity of the ensouled composite rather than a static property.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized to the unified living body or organism.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Mental activity/soul informs and animates the body, providing top-down causal influence essential for agency and unified cognitive functions.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The mind/soul inherently provides the unity of consciousness, as it functions as the substantial form of the entire body/person.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Involved implicitly, as mental activities require representation, but the composite structure fundamentally guarantees the indivisible conscious unity.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Unclear from provided sources; generally, the inclusion of an irreducible non-material component suggests the soul/form is not purely a product of standard Darwinian mechanisms.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "The unity of consciousness cannot be explained solely by an aggregate of physical brain parts.",
      "The soul (form) informs the physical body, making the human person a unified, substantial reality.",

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Conceptually testable (via philosophical argumentation); empirically speculative, as the non-material form is difficult to verify via third-person methods.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "Relies on refuting the explanatory gaps of purely physical theories (e.g., arguments concerning qualia or the unity of self ). (No specific positive empirical tests are listed in the sources for this entry.)",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Faces the mental causation problem: explaining how the non-physical form causally interacts with the physical world without violating the causal closure of physics.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise structure and laws governing the non-material soul/form and its interaction with the physical component remain unknown.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Internally coherent as it posits the person as a single unified substance (avoiding Cartesian substance dualism issues) but conflicts fundamentally with Physicalist ontologies."
