    "summary": "This entry outlines Christof Koch's comparison of Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Panpsychism, arguing that both share the intuition that consciousness is an intrinsic, fundamental property of reality. However, IIT is positioned as superior because it articulates specific criteria (quantified by Phi, $Phi$) for consciousness, resolves the combination problem via the Exclusion Postulate, and offers a concrete empirical research program, unlike traditional Panpsychism.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as unfolded intrinsic causal power, which is fundamentally similar to Panpsychism's view of consciousness as intrinsic, but mathematically specified as a maximally irreducible conceptual structure ($Phi$-structure).",
    "ontological_status": "Panpsychist/Monist (Justified: The comparison draws on the shared premise that consciousness is intrinsic and fundamental to reality, aligning IIT conceptually with panpsychism, although IIT specifies strict mathematical criteria that traditional panpsychism lacks.)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Explanatory Identity (Experience is identical to a $Phi$-structure unfolded from the physical substrate). The relationship is intrinsic, requiring no dualism or emergence, but demanding specific physical configuration.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Fundamental",
    "emergence_type": "None (Justified: Koch argues IIT leaves no room for emergence, consistent with the fundamental nature of consciousness.)",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (experience) is the maximally irreducible conceptual structure ($Phi$-structure), which is inherently for itself. Intentionality corresponds to sub-structures ($Phi$-folds) within this structure.",
    "qualia_account": "IIT provides a detailed mathematical account of how phenomenology (qualitative aspects) can be captured by quantitative considerations (intrinsic causal powers), countering critics who claim quantitative frameworks cannot capture quality. Qualia are identical to the maximally irreducible conceptual structures ($Phi$-structure) in qualia space.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Intrinsic, fundamental property of reality; cause-effect power; conceptual structures ($Phi$-structures) existing in qualia space; physical substrates of consciousness (PSCs).",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible through scientific testability, rigorous mathematical modeling (measurement of $Phi$), and grounded in the phenomenology of experience (axioms).",
    "constituents_and_structure": "Consciousness is a maximally reduced conceptual structure (a shape seen from the inside) in a quasi-dimensional 'qualia space,' determined by the cause-effect structure of a physical system."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Quality/Qualia, Integration/Unity, Specificity/Information",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The Exclusion Postulate: This dictate specifies which aggregate of entities (e.g., neurons) exists as a unitary conscious entity by possessing a maximum amount of integrated information ($Phi$). This mechanism resolves Panpsychism’s combination problem.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Static Property (Justified: Consciousness is an intrinsic property of specific configurations, not a dynamic flow or process like computation. The focus is on structure/existence.)",
    "location_and_distribution": "Consciousness is graded and widespread (shared intuition with Panpsychism); in the brain, it is located in the maximally integrated causal structure (e.g., the posterior cortex).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The intrinsic entity (consciousness) possesses cause-effect power and can constrain its past and future. IIT is claimed to explain why consciousness is adaptive, a failing of traditional Panpsychism.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is an axiom of consciousness, requiring experience to be unified and irreducible. The Exclusion Postulate governs which integrated wholes count as unitary conscious entities.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Consciousness is an information-theoretic property of systems. The amount of consciousness is quantified by integrated information ($Phi$), characterizing the system’s irreducibility.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The ability of consciousness to be adaptive (providing a selective advantage) is offered as a superiority of IIT over Panpsychism, which typically struggles to justify the functional relevance of fundamental consciousness.",

      "IIT provides a conceptual and potentially empirical research program, unlike traditional Panpsychism.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "IIT is criticized for making anti-common sense predictions (imputing consciousness to simple objects) and has been characterized as 'pseudoscience' by a sizable group of researchers. The results of adversarial empirical tests are considered insufficient by critics to justify the core theory.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The empirical neuroscience supporting IIT is still rudimentary, and determining whether the hypothesized consciousness-causing structure ('qualia space') can be manipulated by technology remains unknown.",
    "ontological_coherence": "High (Justified: IIT strongly asserts internal consistency, claiming to leave no room for emergence or dualism by defining phenomenal experience as identically linked to the maximally irreducible $Phi$-structure and physical existence operationally through cause-effect power. IIT distances itself from Panpsychism by imposing strict criteria.)"

      "stance": "Uncertain",
      "rationale": "Survival depends on the unknown nature and technology-manipulability of the non-reducible structure of reality (qualia space) posited by IIT. While some form of persistence is not ruled out, first-person survival is an open question."

Uploading would result in a 'deep fake' lacking subjective experience unless advanced technology can manipulate the consciousness-causing $Phi$-structure."
