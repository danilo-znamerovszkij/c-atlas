    "theory_title": "Nagasawaâ€™s Mind-Body in an Infinitely Decomposable Universe Theory",
    "summary": "This theory challenges traditional metaphysics by positing a universe that lacks a fundamental deepest level (infinite decomposability). It argues that this scenario renders physicalism, dualism, and idealism unstable, thereby motivating a fundamental revision towards a holistic 'Priority Monism' where the universe as a totality is the most fundamental entity.",

    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "The theory focuses on demonstrating the conceptual instability of traditional metaphysical stances (physicalism, dualism, idealism); it does not offer an explicit, positive account of subjectivity or intentionality.",
    "qualia_account": "The conceptual foundations of existing qualia accounts (as properties of fundamental micro-entities) are undermined, but the theory offers no constructive replacement for the qualitative feel.",
    "ontological_commitments": "The totality of everything, conceived as an organic whole, is the single fundamental existent. It fundamentally denies the existence of a deepest, indivisible level of reality.",
    "epistemic_access": "Philosophical reasoning and thought experiment, primarily demonstrating metaphysical constraints rather than relying on empirical or introspective data.",

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The infinite decomposability of existence serves as a conceptual constraint, invalidating theories reliant on bottom-up composition and necessitating a top-down, holistic explanation.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness arises as a consequence of the universe being considered as a singular whole (the fundamental entity), rather than accumulating from local, micro-level processes.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Systemic/Cosmic, distributed as an aspect of the fundamentally holistic universe.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Functional role and causation are uncertain, as the focus is on metaphysical stability. The framework implies that causation is rooted in the dynamics of the whole, rather than local interactions of micro-constituents.",

      "The existence of an infinitely decomposable universe invalidates all traditional micro-fundamentalist theories of consciousness.",

    "testability_status": "Conceptually testable, but empirically speculative. It challenges the definitional stability of empirically favored theories like physicalism.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "No known empirical tests described. The theory operates at a metaphysical level outside current empirical science.",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "It relies on the radical and unproven cosmological assumption of infinite decomposability. It provides only a philosophical critique and diagnosis without offering detailed, constructive mechanics of consciousness.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "Does not specify the mechanism by which individual consciousness is derived from the cosmic whole, nor how it reconciles with phenomenal experience. It is classified by Kuhn as a Challenge Theory, highlighting its lack of prescriptive solutions.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent based on its premise of infinite decomposability, leading logically to Priority Monism. However, the foundational premise violates the assumptions of contemporary scientific ontology regarding fundamental levels of nature."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Uncertain",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is a derived property of the fundamental cosmic whole and its entanglement. Whether artificial systems could capture sufficient 'totality' or 'entanglement' to generate phenomenal experience is highly speculative within this framework."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Possibly",
      "rationale": "If individual consciousness is a non-local, derived component of the eternal, single fundamental entity (the universe), its informational structure may persist beyond biological dissolution."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Possibly",
      "rationale": "Defining the universe as the single, fundamental, organic whole suggests a form of cosmic teleology or inherent significance, aligning with metaphysical monist traditions that imply purpose."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Uncertain",
      "rationale": "Achieving virtual immortality relies on the ability to isolate and duplicate a mind's precise computational pattern. This goal seems difficult to realize if reality lacks fundamental, reproducible micro-constituents and is defined instead by holistic entanglement."
