    "summary": "This theory posits 'sentience' (the capacity to feel) as a fundamental dimension of consciousness, arising from intrinsic temporo-spatial mechanisms in the brain . It argues that consciousness is generated by the brain continuously integrating inputs from the body and environment within its ongoing spontaneous temporo-spatial matrix .",

    "mind_body_relationship": "The theory advocates for a 'non-reductive neurophilosophy' that conceives the neuro-mental relationship in dynamic spatiotemporal terms . It aims to dissolve the classical mind-body problem by replacing it with the 'world-brain relation' .",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Non-reductive/Strong Emergence. The theory seeks to link concepts and facts without reducing the mental to the physical, focusing on the distinct organizational structure ('form') of consciousness .",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity relates to the structure or form/organization of consciousness . Intentional mental features (like representations of objects) are characterized as short and restricted spatiotemporal scales that are nested within the brain's larger spontaneous activity .",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are addressed implicitly through 'sentience' (the capacity to feel) which is a fundamental dimension of consciousness enabled by specific intrinsically temporo-spatial mechanisms .",
    "ontological_commitments": "Brain spontaneous activity, temporo-spatial relationships, nested scales of mental features, and neuro-ecological/neuro-visceral mechanisms .",
    "epistemic_access": "Knowledge is accessed via 'spatiotemporal neuroscience,' which focuses on brain activity and structure rather than the input-cognition-output framework of traditional cognitive neuroscience . It requires a systematic, bilateral connection of theoretical concepts and empirical data .",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The structure involves inherently nested spatiotemporal scales of brain activity (like Russian dolls) , with sentience being constituted by temporo-spatial mechanisms within the spontaneous activity matrix ."

    "causation_and_functional_role": "The functional role is to enable 'sentience' or the capacity to feel . This framework shifts the focus from input-cognition-output causation to dynamic spatiotemporal relationships .",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration occurs through the continuous process by which the brain unifies diverse inputs from the body and environment within its spontaneous temporo-spatial matrix .",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information flow is linked to spatiotemporal scales; mental representations are smaller, nested scales abstracted or detached from the underlying long, extended brain activity scale .",
    "evolutionary_account": "Not explicitly discussed in the provided sources. Given its grounding in basic brain/body integration via spatiotemporal mechanisms, evolution likely selected for this capacity for felt experience (sentience) to aid homeostatic regulation and adaptive survival.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Northoff’s approach counters traditional functional and cognitive characterizations, but must avoid the pitfall of abstracting mental features so much that they appear non-dynamic or detached from their underlying context, like removing a smaller 'Russian doll' from the nested set and examining it in isolation .",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise mapping of mental features onto specific nested spatiotemporal scales remains an open problem . The approach is acknowledged as primarily a methodological strategy (non-reductive neurophilosophy) .",
    "ontological_coherence": "High, within its own framework, as it aims to logically account for the brain-mind relationship by emphasizing non-reductive spatial and temporal structure over input-output functions, aiming to dissolve the mind-body dichotomy ."

      "stance": "Conditional",
      "rationale": "Consciousness requires highly specific 'intrinsically temporo-spatial' and 'neuro-visceral' mechanisms that integrate inputs within the brain's spontaneous matrix . Artificial systems would need to instantiate this exact, complex nested biological/ecological organization to achieve sentience, implying difficulty but not impossibility in principle."

      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Sentience is rooted in specific biological, neuro-visceral mechanisms and spontaneous brain activity . Cessation of this physical organizational matrix would imply the dissolution of consciousness, consistent with its underlying materialist classification."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Humanistic only",
      "rationale": "The theory is concerned with identifying the basic structure of sentience within a neurophilosophical context, offering no basis for cosmic teleology or ultimate meaning beyond the derived purpose of biological existence."

      "stance": "Conditional",
      "rationale": "Requires the precise duplication and continuation of the brain's unique 'ongoing temporo-spatial matrix' and its nested structure, encompassing internal (neuro-visceral) and external (neuro-ecological) inputs . Merely replicating function might be insufficient if the physical realization of the nested spatiotemporal *structure* is constitutive of sentience."
