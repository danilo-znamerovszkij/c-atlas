    "theory_title": "Tegmarkâ€™s State of Matter",
    "summary": "Tegmark proposes that consciousness can be understood as a specific state of matter, coined 'perceptronium,' which is defined by distinctive information-processing abilities. Starting from the premise that all existence is physical, the theory seeks principles that distinguish conscious, complex information processing from non-conscious processing.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as the subjective experience or 'feeling' that arises when information is being processed in certain complex ways, constituting the state of matter termed 'perceptronium'.",

    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is defined as the 'way information feels when being processed in certain complex ways'. Intentionality is implicitly treated as a complex, high-level informational capability achievable by perceptronium.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are implicitly the 'feeling' (subjective experience) associated with perceptronium's specific information processing configurations, formalized through four principles: information, integration, independence, and dynamics.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical systems, information. The theory is founded on the larger ontological claim that all reality is a fundamental mathematical structure.",
    "epistemic_access": "Consciousness is accessed and known through the objective physical and mathematical principles governing information flow (information, integration, independence, and dynamics).",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The structure is 'perceptronium,' a state of matter defined by four principles: information, integration, independence, and dynamics. This framework generalizes Integrated Information Theory (IIT) for arbitrary quantum systems."

    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is crucial for information assessment and is viewed as functionally important for critical needs like caring for comatose patients or communicating with advanced AI. Causation is strictly physical.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is one of the four principles defining perceptronium, suggesting it is a crucial mechanism for unified conscious experience.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is foundational, as consciousness is the subjective feeling of information being processed. The mechanism is driven entirely by informational principles.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The approach sits apart from materialist theories where consciousness is a contingency of evolution, instead relating it to the underlying mathematical nature of reality.",

      "stance": "Uncertain/Humanistic only",
