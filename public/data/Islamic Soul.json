    "theory_title": "Islamic Soul Theory",
    "summary": "This dualistic philosophical framework posits that the human person is essentially composed of a physical body and an independent, nonphysical substance, often called the soul or nafs, which is generated or placed by God. The theory addresses the relationship between the soul and body, asserting the soul's independence and persistence after death.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as a 'spiritual light' that God has placed into the human being, residing in the nonphysical soul or nafs.",
    "ontological_status": "Substance Dualism (A separate, independent nonphysical substance—the soul—exists alongside the physical body).",
    "mind_body_relationship": "The relationship is shaped by the unification of the soul with the body, the soul's effect on the body, its independence, and its separation after the body's death. The soul acts as the central organizing and sustaining principle for the body, though the soul is accidentally related to a particular body (Avicenna's view).",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive/Created",
    "emergence_type": "N/A (The soul is considered an independent substance, often generated or emanated by divine intelligences or God, rather than emerging from physical processes.)",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is inherent to the non-physical soul (nafs, meaning self/psyche) which is the source of consciousness. Intentionality and thought are realized through hierarchical faculties of the soul, culminating in the rational faculty.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualitative experience is intrinsic to the non-physical soul or 'spiritual light' that constitutes consciousness, meaning the feeling of experience resides in this immaterial essence.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical bodies, nonphysical substantial souls/spirits, and a higher ontological reality (e.g., separate intelligences or God) that is the ultimate source of the soul.",
    "epistemic_access": "Consciousness is accessed through philosophical/theological evaluation and spiritual practice, such as the remembrance of God used to 'polish the mirror of the soul'.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic constituent is the immaterial soul (*nafs*), which may have a hierarchical structure of faculties (e.g., nutritive, sensory, imaginative, and rational, as described by Averroes).",
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal consciousness, intellective processes, and self-awareness (via nafs)."
  },
  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The function of consciousness is mediated by a spiritual light (the soul) which, upon unification with the body, acts as its organizing and sustaining principle, affecting the body's existence.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Non-Applicable/Creation (The soul is a created or emanated substance and does not arise dynamically from physical brain processes).",
    "location_and_distribution": "The nonphysical soul is unified with the physical body, acting as its form or organizing principle during life, but is capable of independent existence.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The soul exerts causal influence by sustaining the body and enabling higher faculties like rational thought. However, like all substance dualisms, the mechanism of physical-nonphysical interaction is subject to the mental causation problem.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved through the soul acting as a single, substantial reality that informs and unifies the various faculties and components of the body.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is processed hierarchically through the soul's faculties, leading to increasingly complex cognitive functions, culminating in the rational/intellective soul.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Not primarily based on phylogenetic evolution (Justification: The theory is rooted in theological and philosophical accounts of creation, rather than material evolutionary processes, though Averroes describes a hierarchy of faculties in the soul.)",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "The soul is an immaterial substance (nafs) that is central to human existence.",
      "Consciousness is fundamentally a 'spiritual light' gifted by God to human beings.",
      "The soul is independent of the body and preserves its individuality upon separation after death."
    ],
    "basis_of_belief_or_evidence_type": "Theological, Philosophical, Phenomenological"
  },
  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Speculative/Philosophical (Justification: The theory relies on the existence of a spiritual, non-material substance—the soul—which is not accessible by current scientific third-person methods, placing it outside of standard empirical investigation.)",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "None (Justification: No empirical interventions designed to test the existence or operation of the spiritual light or immaterial nafs are referenced in the sources.)",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Like other forms of substance dualism, this theory faces the challenge of explaining coherent ontological, causal, or epistemological continuity between the non-physical soul and the physical brain (the mind-body interaction problem).",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise nature of the soul's composition and how it interacts causally with the physical body, as well as the question of whether the soul preserves complete, self-aware individuality in its separated state after death.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent within a dualistic and theistic framework where a Divine source (God) supplies or emanates the nonphysical substance (soul), supporting a multi-level reality."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "If consciousness requires a nonphysical soul that is divinely created or emanated, artificial intelligence (AI) systems, which are purely material, cannot attain true consciousness."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "The soul is an independent substance considered 'aeviternal' (having a beginning but no end) that separates from the body at death, allowing for survival and continuation of development in a meta cosmic state."
    },
    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Ultimate/Cosmic",
      "rationale": "Consciousness and the soul are fundamentally linked to God and creation, imbuing human existence with ultimate, divinely rooted meaning and purpose."
    },
    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Impossible",
      "rationale": "Virtual immortality relies on duplicating the physical neural structure. Since consciousness requires a nonphysical soul substance, replicating only the physical components would result in a non-conscious entity, making first-person persistence impossible."
