    "summary": "This maximalist physicalist position holds that our common-sense view of the mind (folk psychology) is a radically false theory that must be displaced by completed neuroscience. Phenomenal consciousness, including qualia, is considered a kind of illusion generated by the brain—a contingent, evolutionary, inner adaptation that enhanced fitness.",

    "ontological_status": "Maximalist Physicalism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "The common-sense conception of psychological phenomena (mind) is radically false and will be displaced entirely (eliminated) by the conceptual framework of completed neuroscience (brain states), rather than smoothly reduced.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence (Justification: The theory posits that the illusion arises from complex physical processes and explicitly rejects the need for irreducible, mysterious mental properties, consistent with weak emergence, even though the concept of 'consciousness' itself is eliminated as an entity.)",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity and the intentional contents of folk psychology are either illusory or incoherent, and must be reconstituted within the conceptual framework of completed neuroscience.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (qualitative features of phenomenal consciousness) are rejected as illusory and incoherent, understood instead as 'user-illusions' generated by complex activated neural networks that dispose us to report experiences.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical entities described by the scientific image (physics, chemistry, molecular biology, and neurophysiology). Common-sense mental entities are denied/eliminated.",
    "epistemic_access": "Knowledge of consciousness must be gained via the objective, third-person point of view of science, treating introspection only as 'data to be explained,' using methods like heterophenomenology.",

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal (as an illusion), Access (as computational functions), Self-awareness (as a 'center of narrative gravity').",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle of displacement/elimination, where the defective ontology and principles of folk psychology are replaced by the concepts of completed neuroscience. The illusion itself is an inner adaptation enhancing fitness.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "The illusion of consciousness is a contingent, evolutionary, inner adaptation. The 'real patterns' underlying manifest experience are truly represented by the scientific, physical description.",

    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness (the illusion/concept) functions as a contingent adaptation that enhanced fitness and reproductive success for the organism.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved through the underlying complex neural activity and information processing that results in the formation of the reported phenomenal experience, often described functionally (e.g., Dennett’s multiple drafts model leading to 'fame in the brain').",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information processing in the brain generates the illusion, often described through parallel, multitrack interpretations and continuous editorial revision leading to a narrative stream.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness is an evolved, contingent, inner adaptation that enhanced fitness and reproductive success, illustrating design without a designer and reasons without a reasoner.",

It is criticized for either ignoring the emergent properties of the central nervous system or for implicitly committing to the denial of determinate content of thought.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The theory relies entirely on the successful completion of neuroscience to justify the displacement of folk psychology, a task not yet achieved. It struggles to make the identification of consciousness with neural activity intelligible to philosophical skeptics.",
