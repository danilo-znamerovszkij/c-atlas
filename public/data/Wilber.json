    "theory_title": "Integral Theory",
    "summary": "Integral Theory is an overarching metatheory seeking to harmonize over one hundred diverse philosophical and spiritual theories into a single, coherent framework that accounts for the human condition. It posits a developmental spectrum of consciousness, charting an evolutionary course from ancient proto-consciousness to ultimate spiritual attainment.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as a developmental spectrum existing within the 'Kosmos', evolving from proto-consciousness towards ultimate Spirit.",
    "ontological_status": "Monism/Idealism Hybrid",
    "mind_body_relationship": "A complex, non-reductive relationship (Dual-Aspect Developmental Monism) where mind and consciousness emerge from matter but ultimately strive to restore primordial unity with a transcendental reality (Spirit).",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive in its basal proto-form, leading to highly Emergent levels (Soul and Spirit).",
    "emergence_type": "Strong Emergence for higher levels (Soul, Spirit), as these are conceptualized as realms that transcend matter and life, non-reducible to their physical basis.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is central, particularly in the individual quadrants of the AQAL model, detailing individual psychology and the quest for spiritual attainment/enlightenment; intentionality is implied by the goal-directed evolutionary drive toward Spirit.",
    "qualia_account": "Not explicitly detailed in the source, but implied to be inherent and structured within the developmental spectrum of consciousness and integral to the spectrum of individual experience.",
    "ontological_commitments": "The Kosmos, conceived as concentric spheres (matter, life, mind, soul, Spirit), and the structured four quadrants of the AQAL model (Interior/Exterior, Individual/Collective).",
    "epistemic_access": "Introspection, contemplative practices (meditative traditions), and comprehensive cross-cultural philosophical and psychological synthesis.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic structure is the AQAL (All Quadrants All Levels) model, a 2x2 grid, organizing individual and collective expressions across internal (consciousness) and external (physical) dimensions."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Self-awareness, Spiritual Attainment, Individual Psychology, and Collective Social organization.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle of evolution across a spectrum of consciousness, organized and mapped by the AQAL framework, unifying diverse levels of reality and experience.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic, evolutionary process driven toward increasing complexification and the restoration of primordial unity with transcendental consciousness.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Distributed throughout the 'Kosmos' across various levels: matter, life, mind, soul, and Spirit; organized systemically within both individual and collective realms (AQAL).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Drives the grand cosmic system of continuing complexification and the evolution of the Kosmos, ultimately serving spiritual realization and minimizing philosophical naturalism.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved via the meta-theoretical AQAL framework, which unifies otherwise disparate psychological, spiritual, and physical dimensions into a single coherent system.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information and knowledge are integrated, categorized, and mapped across the developmental levels and quadrants of the AQAL system.",
    "evolutionary_account": "An explicit developmental and evolutionary account where consciousness emerges from proto-consciousness in non-life and evolves through life and mind toward ultimate spirit/spiritual attainment.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Integral Theory attempts to harmonize over 100 diverse philosophical and spiritual theories into one coherent framework.",
      "Consciousness operates on an evolutionary developmental spectrum, moving toward ultimate spiritual attainment.",

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Conceptually testable via philosophical evaluation of its coherence and its capacity to integrate existing psychological and spiritual knowledge; empirical testing of ultimate spiritual claims is speculative.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "Relies on insights derived from developmental psychology, consciousness studies, and meditative traditions.",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Not explicitly critiqued in the source, but the theory stands in opposition to philosophical naturalism and seeks to defeat Materialism Theories of consciousness, creating a foundational tension with conventional science.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The explicit challenge is integrating spiritual concerns with the modern scientific worldview; the model's efficacy relies on its ability to undermine reductionist Materialism Theories.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within its own comprehensive metatheoretical structure (AQAL), designed explicitly to reconcile diverse ontological categories (matter, mind, soul, Spirit)."

    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Conditional",
      "rationale": "AI systems may achieve lower levels (matter/mind/computational complexity), but achieving the higher, non-physical levels of Soul or Spirit seems unlikely without the developmental pathway inherent in the Kosmos."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "The theory incorporates non-physical realms like 'Soul' and 'Spirit' and posits an evolutionary path toward ultimate transcendental consciousness, aligning with the idea of post-mortem persistence."

      "stance": "Conditional",
      "rationale": "Achieving true virtual immortality would require capturing or simulating the non-physical/spiritual spheres of the Kosmos (Soul/Spirit), which are necessary for the individual's full identity and highest developmental levels."
