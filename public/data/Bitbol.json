    "theory_title": "Bitbol's Radical Neurophenomenology",
    "summary": "This theory proposes a radical dissolution of the hard problem of consciousness by prioritizing the effective primacy of lived experience over any objective account. It asserts that neuroscientific data and phenomenal descriptions are ontologically equivalent, arising from a 'tangled dialectic' between body and consciousness, rather than consciousness fundamentally depending on the brain.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is the effective primacy of lived experience, defining reality as that which is given and manifest, conditional upon which objectivity is constituted by extracting structural invariants.",
    "ontological_status": "Phenomenological Ontology / Non-standard Monism. It suspends judgment on an objective external domain and strives toward an 'endo-ontology' (an engaged ontology of being) rather than objective reality.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "A 'tangled dialectic of body and consciousness' or a 'dynamical and participatory conception.' The neuro-phenomenological correlation is viewed as an extension of the lived sense of embodiment, not a sign of one-directional dependence on the brain.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Effectively primary/Fundamental. The approach shifts the focus from seeking the physical *origin* of subjectivity to recognizing its irreducible status as a precondition of knowledge.",
    "emergence_type": "Dissolution. The theory aims to dissolve the hard problem entirely by changing the fundamental attitude toward it, thereby making traditional emergence concepts irrelevant.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (first-person perspective/lived experience) is central and primary. Intentionality is conceived as the activity of consciousness in constituting or disclosing the world and its objects.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia, or pure experience, are fundamental, and the approach is designed to dispel the sense that their origin requires a theoretical, objective solution. Phenomenological descriptions of experience are given equivalent ontological status to neuroscientific data.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Lived experience, embodiment, Merleau-Ponty’s ‘endo-ontology’ (self-manifesting being), and Varela's formalism of ‘cybernetic dialectic.’",
    "epistemic_access": "First-person inquiry (via faithful exploration of lived experience, specifically through micro-phenomenological interviews) alongside third-person objective inquiry. The former is prioritized for ultimate understanding.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The approach focuses on clarifying how objectification is obtained out of the coordination of subjective experiences, utilizing a 'cybernetic dialectic' formalism for the relation between body and consciousness."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal consciousness (pure experience), Subjectivity, Self-awareness (as defined phenomenologically).",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Radical dissolution of the Hard Problem, achieved by relocating the issue from an intellectual puzzle concerning objective origin onto the plane of existential attitudes and self-transformation.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Dynamic process characterized by a suspension of objective judgment and a redirection of attention toward the activity of constituting objects. The relationship between body and consciousness is conceived as dynamical and participatory.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The location is distributed in the 'lived sense of embodiment' and the tangled dialectic between body and consciousness, rejecting the idea of consciousness fundamentally depending solely on the bodily brain.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness functions as the condition of possibility for objectivity. By developing inquiry into subjective experience, the mechanism of objectification (extracting structural invariants from experience) is clarified.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved by weaving together phenomenological and neurobiological accounts to bridge the subjective experience and biology gap, realizing the goal of neurophenomenology.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "The theory focuses on the first-person activity of constituting objects and does not grant superior status to neuroscientific data/representations. It aims to clarify how objectification (structural invariants) arises from given experience.",

      "Micro-phenomenological interviews (methodology for exploring lived experience)"
    ],
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The approach runs the risk of 'being either ignored or considered as a dodge' because it requires researchers to abandon the stance of neutral observers and seek self-transformation. It rejects standard physicalist monism and property dualism.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The difficulty lies in persuading researchers to suspend the objective quest for the origin of subjectivity and shift to an existential mode of inquiry, which is highly demanding.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent internally, aligning with Merleau-Ponty's 'endo-ontology' and non-interpretational quantum approaches (QBism). It is explicitly inconsistent with reductive physicalism."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Uncertain/Conditional",
      "rationale": "Consciousness requires a 'tangled dialectic of body and consciousness' and prioritizing lived, subjective experience, which are generally antithetical to purely objective/computational accounts required for standard AI consciousness models. Consciousness is not fundamentally computational."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Possibly",
      "rationale": "The approach rejects the one-directional, fundamental dependence of consciousness on the bodily brain, viewing neuro-phenomenological correlation as extension of embodiment. This conceptual space suggests non-physicalist persistence may be possible, especially given the framework's use in interpreting altered states of consciousness."
    },
    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Existential/Philosophical",
      "rationale": "The approach transforms the hard problem into an 'existential option' and focuses on Merleau-Ponty’s ‘intra-ontology’ (the process of what it is like to be), suggesting meaning is intrinsically tied to lived being and self-disclosure."
    },
    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Unlikely",
      "rationale": "Virtual immortality relies on functionalist duplication, but this theory asserts the 'effective primacy of lived experience' and embodiment. Uploading objective data would likely miss the irreducible, subjective mode of being (endo-ontology) required for identity preservation."
