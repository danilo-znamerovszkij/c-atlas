    "summary": "This theory posits that consciousness is a non-reducible product of the biological brain, but mental states have absolutely no causal power over physical reality. Our subjective awareness is real, yet our perception that our thoughts cause actions is mistaken, as consciousness is entirely inert, like foam on an ocean wave.",

    "mind_body_relationship": "Mental states are entirely the product of biological brains. Physical states cause phenomenal states, but phenomenal states have no causal effect on the physical (one-directional causation).",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent. Consciousness is solely the product of biological brains.",
    "emergence_type": "The properties are irreducible and ontologically distinct from physical properties , suggesting a form of strong emergence for the phenomenal property, even if it is causally inert. (Justified based on irreducibility claim ).",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Awareness of consciousness is real. Subjectivity (phenomenal properties) is ontologically distinct. The sense of mental causation is illusory.",

    "causation_and_functional_role": "Mental states have no causal powers. The mind is entirely inert and there is no 'top-down causation'; consciousness is a non-functional byproduct.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Unification of experience is implicitly achieved by the underlying complex physical processes in the brain that produce the unified phenomenal state. (Justified: The focus is on the lack of outgoing causality, not internal unity mechanics).",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information processing is entirely physical/unconscious, and the phenomenal experience is a non-causal parallel output of this processing.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Implicitly compatible with evolution, as consciousness is a product of biological brains. The property's reality suggests it arose via evolution, though its lack of function means it was not selected for its causal efficacy.

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Conceptually challenged. Its primary claim—that conscious states lack causal force—is counterintuitive and difficult to test empirically, as it involves proving a negative causal link.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The theory is counterintuitive because it strongly seems to us that our phenomenally conscious states causally matter. It forces the acceptance that our sense of mental causation (thoughts causing things) is a 'kind of illusion or trick'.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The integration of mental causation is central, as Epiphenomenalism solves the problem by denying causation, but this requires accepting a highly counterintuitive result.",
    "ontological_coherence": "High coherence within a materialist ontology committed to the complete causal closure of the physical, achieving a weak form of dualism while avoiding interactionist problems."
