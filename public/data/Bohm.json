    "theory_title": "Bohm’s Implicate-Explicate Order",
    "summary": "This theory proposes that reality consists of two levels: the hidden, fundamental Implicate Order, and the manifest Explicate Order. Consciousness and matter are conceived as extensions or projections arising from this common higher-dimensional Implicate Order. The theory seeks to integrate consciousness into the ontological implications of quantum theory.",

    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind and body do not causally affect one another but are related projections resulting from the shared, ultimate reality of the Implicate Order. This relationship reflects a decompositional dual-aspect theory.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Strong Emergence (from a neutral, fundamental domain). Consciousness emerges by 'explication' or 'unfoldment' from the holistic Implicate Order.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is implied by Bohm's emphasis on 'undivided wholeness,' where the subject actively participates with the object, rather than being a detached observer. Intentionality is not explicitly detailed in the provided sources.",
    "qualia_account": "Not explicitly detailed, but qualia (the basic qualities of consciousness) are implied to be essential differences recognized between consciousness and matter, both of which are projections of the underlying order.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Implicate Order (holistic, higher-dimensional actuality), Explicate Order (manifest reality), and, in derived theories, quantum potential energy and active information.",
    "epistemic_access": "Access is conceptual, achieved by leveraging the counterintuitive concepts of quantum mechanics to question established notions of physical reality and infer the existence of a deeper level.",

    "causation_and_functional_role": "Mind and body movements are related projections of a common ground; consciousness facilitates a move toward 'undivided wholeness' and active participation with reality, rather than detached observation.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is intrinsic, rooted in the fundamental concept of 'undivided wholeness' that characterizes the Implicate Order. Memory involves information being 'enfolded' and 'unfolded' during recall.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information flow is central, particularly concepts like active information within the quantum potential energy, and the enfolding/unfolding of memories.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Not explicitly addressed. The sources focus on the theory’s ontological foundation in physics rather than its biological or phylogenetic adaptive role.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The theory relies on leveraging counterintuitive concepts of quantum mechanics and includes speculations that are acknowledged to exceed the scope of contemporary quantum theory.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "A primary limitation is detailing the mechanism of how consciousness and matter, both projections, connect and express themselves, given the vast differences in their qualities.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within its own monistic framework, successfully addressing the mind-body split by positing a common, psychophysically neutral foundation."
