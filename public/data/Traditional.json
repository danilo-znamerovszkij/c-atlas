    "summary": "This category encompasses dualistic theories prevalent across millennia, often assuming a nonphysical aspect of mind (such as a soul) separate from the physical body. These dualisms, including those found in ancient philosophy and major religious traditions (like Abrahamic religions and certain Indian schools), assert that reality consists of at least two distinct ontological categories: physical and nonphysical.",

    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is inherent to the nonphysical substance (soul/spirit), which acts as the first-person experiencer or 'I'. Intentionality is often viewed as a property of this distinct mental substance.",

    "epistemic_access": "Generally known through common intuition, philosophical rumination, and religious/spiritual traditions, rather than empirical science.",

    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information or representation is a property of the mental substance, which is characterized as thoroughly teleological and inherently intentional.",
