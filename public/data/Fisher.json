    "summary": "This theory proposes that quantum processing involving nuclear spins is operative in the brain and key to its functioning, serving as the biological mechanism for consciousness. It posits that phosphorus nuclear spins act as qubits (neural qubits) protected by Posner molecules, enabling quantum entanglement necessary to influence neural activity.",
