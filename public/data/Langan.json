    "summary": "CTMU proposes that reality is fundamentally information and consciousness, viewing the universe as a Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language (SCSPL) that generates itself out of possibility. Human minds are localized, superficial strata of this reality, which is ultimately God’s all-knowing consciousness.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as stratified reality, with the bottom stratum being the all-knowing mind of God. Reality itself is fundamentally digital information and a vast network of conscious experiences.",
    "ontological_status": "Idealism/Monism (Consciousness is the ultimate fundamental existent)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "The human mind (a superficial stratum of consciousness) is contained within God's infinite consciousness, which manifests the physical universe as an informational structure unfolding in space and time.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive",
    "emergence_type": "N/A: Consciousness (God's mind) is fundamental and is required for reality's existence, making emergence irrelevant in the traditional sense.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is inherent because reality can only be perceived or known through consciousness. Intentionality and free will are retained by human minds, which are localized pieces of God's consciousness, and are related to aligning actions with the cosmic 'telos'.",
    "qualia_account": "The phenomenal qualities of experience are implied as the way localized conscious minds perceive the informational structure of reality.",

    "epistemic_access": "Reality is accessible through consciousness, as consciousness is the only means by which anything can be perceived or known at all.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic structure is a reflexive intrinsic language (SCSPL) characterized by self-reference and recursive self-definition. Consciousness is stratified, with the bottom stratum (God's mind) encompassing all more superficial strata (human minds)."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Self-awareness, Soul, Afterlife, Free Will, Morality.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The universe is modeled as a Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language (SCSPL), a logical framework that provides the conditions necessary for reality to generate itself out of nothingness.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness (God’s mind) is eternal but contains all processes required to refine itself into existence. The universe appears to human minds as a physical entity unfolding in time, reflecting these processes.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Human conscious minds are localized in time and space but are contained within God's consciousness, the all-pervading bottom stratum of reality.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness, particularly in its localized form (human minds), retains creative power and free will on a local scale. Causal actions are aligned with an absolute moral 'telos'.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The unity of experience is explained by the ultimate unity of the fundamental reality: God's all-knowing, unchanging consciousness contains all localized minds.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Reality is structured as digital information and mathematical relationships that are processed and experienced as a vast network of conscious experiences under the framework of the SCSPL.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Focuses on the self-creation and self-refinement of the informational system of reality itself, rather than standard biological or phylogenetic evolution.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Information is the most fundamental constituent of reality, which is a Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language.",
      "The universe is self-creating, requiring nothing outside of itself to exist.",

    "testability_status": "Speculative/Conceptual. The theory provides a highly complex logical framework but is not readily subject to empirical scientific testing.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The theory is generally dismissed by the broader scientific and philosophical communities. Critiques focus on its highly speculative nature and its reliance on complex, non-standard metaphysical concepts, such as the self-generation of God’s mind.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The primary limitation is its highly abstract, non-empirical basis, relying on dense metaphysical argument rather than verifiable data to establish its claims about reality and consciousness.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent internally, arguing that the self-referencing nature of the SCSPL ensures reality cannot not exist, though it is fundamentally incompatible with traditional physicalist frameworks."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Conditional",
      "rationale": "If reality is fundamentally digital information structured by the SCSPL, AI systems could potentially instantiate consciousness, but only if they replicate or align with the specific stratified informational structure inherent in God's consciousness."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "The theory explicitly claims to prove the existence of the soul and an afterlife. Elements of the mind matching the ultimate 'telos' (God's mind) are preserved, securing post-mortem survival."
    },
    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "The theory is embedded with absolute morality and karma, positing a cosmological goal ('telos'). Ultimate meaning and purpose are provided by the fundamental existence of God's all-knowing consciousness, which serves as the bottom stratum of reality."
    },
    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Likely/Conditional",
      "rationale": "As consciousness is informational, digital duplication is plausible in principle, but true, meaningful immortality (persistence of the soul) is conditioned upon the individual's moral alignment with the 'telos' of the universe."
