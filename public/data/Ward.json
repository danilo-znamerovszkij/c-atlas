    "theory_title": "Ward’s Personal Idealism: Souls as Embodied Agents Created by God",
    "summary": "This theory posits consciousness as the ultimate reality (Idealism), focusing on the irreducible conscious subject, or soul. It frames the soul as an embodied agent created by God, meaning the subject is distinct from, but inseparable from, the objective physical world. The world itself is viewed as a construct of perceptions and thoughts, affirming the primacy of the first-person perspective.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is the embodied subject of intellectual and moral agency (the soul); the world is a construct of the subject’s perceptions, feelings, and thoughts.",
    "ontological_status": "Idealism (Theistic/Personal Idealism)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind and body/brain are a subject-object relation, where the subject (perceiver/thinker/soul) is embodied, meaning there is no subject without an objective environment, but the subject is not reducible to publicly observable physical facts.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive",
    "emergence_type": "The theory operates on the premise that consciousness is fundamental and the starting point for all knowledge, thus it is not emergent from material processes.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is fundamental, as consciousness is the starting point of all knowledge. The soul provides intellectual and moral agency, implying intentionality.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (the 'what-it-is-like' experience) is accommodated by the assertion that consciousness is irreducible to physical particles and must be the intrinsic content of the perceiver/subject.",
    "ontological_commitments": "God (as creator), Souls (as embodied agents), Perceptions, Thoughts, and an objective Environment/Objectivity (necessary for embodiment).",
    "epistemic_access": "Introspection/First-person perspective. Consciousness is the necessary starting point for all knowledge.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The structure consists of a perceiving, thinking subject (the soul) which is always bound to an object (the body/environment), where the world is constructed from the subject’s mental activity."

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle of the irreducible, embodied subject (soul) who perceives and constructs the world through internal mental activity (perceptions, feelings, thoughts).",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is static in its fundamental nature (pure awareness) but dynamically engaged as a subject thinking and perceiving in its environment.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The conscious subject (soul) is embodied, requiring an objective environment, but is not spatially identifiable purely by publicly observable physical facts.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness (the soul) serves the function of intellectual and moral agency, possessing non-physical causal power over its physical expression (the embodiment).",
    "integration_or_binding": "The unity of consciousness is presupposed in the concept of the singular perceiving 'subject' and is dismissed as a non-problem when considering the subject's unity.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "The world is represented as a 'construct' of perceptions and feelings and thoughts, which are internally generated by the conscious subject.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The theory focuses on the creation of souls by God and does not rely on a phylogenetic evolutionary explanation for the existence of consciousness itself.",

    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Critiques focus on the reliance on non-physical components (souls) and divine creation, which clashes with mainstream materialism. It highlights the profound philosophical divide with neurophysiology, which denies the non-reducibility of consciousness.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The theory must reconcile the metaphysical reality of a soul created by God with empirical scientific descriptions of the brain. It also faces the challenge of explaining how matter emerges from consciousness if consciousness is primary.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent within its self-defined Personal Idealism framework, as it successfully integrates the subjective reality of consciousness and theological commitments by defining matter as derivative or a construct."

    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Conditional",
