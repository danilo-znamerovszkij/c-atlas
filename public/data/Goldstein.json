    "summary": "This theory asserts that consciousness consists entirely of brain matter, rejecting nonmaterial states. However, it centers the mind-body problem on the idea that while physical processes can be analyzed completely by science (the external description), the internal subjective description of a person (thoughts, emotions, feelings) cannot be derived or fully accessed by that purely physical description, highlighting a persistent explanatory gap.",

    "mind_body_relationship": "Conscious states are radically identical to brain states (Materialist Identity Theory), but the conceptual complexity of the subjective (internal) description cannot be deduced from the descriptive analysis of the physical (external) brain state.",

    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence/Explanatory Gap. Consciousness is ultimately material, but its subjective description cannot, even in principle, be derived from the objective description of the physical substrate.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is the 'inner description' of being a person (thoughts, emotions, dreams), which a complete analysis of the physical brain cannot fully access or describe. Intentional states are entirely based on brain stuff.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (states of feeling) are aspects of the internal description of conscious experience that are entirely brain stuff but are not fully articulable by the purely physical vocabulary of science.",

    "epistemic_access": "The internal description is known primarily through the first-person perspective, such as when creating a character in a novel. The third-person scientific approach (analyzing the brain) is inherently limited in accessing this knowledge.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic underlying stuff is 'entirely brain stuff'. The core structure revolves around the tension between the physical/analyzable description and the inner/inaccessible description of a single material reality."

      "stance": "Uncertain",
      "rationale": "While ontologically physicalist, the theory's focus on the irreducibly rich inner life of the person implies a profound, inherent value in subjectivity, though it does not mandate a cosmic or ultimate purpose."

      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "If conscious states are identical to physical brain states (brain stuff), then a perfect duplication or uploading of those physical states into a new medium should logically preserve the original first-person mental self."
