    "summary": "This perspective challenges the view that consciousness is an ultimate mystery, arguing instead that it is likely a comprehensible phenomenon accessible via scientific methods, especially through integrating concepts from relational physics and artificial intelligence (AI) research. It maintains cautious optimism that the hard problem can eventually be solved.",
