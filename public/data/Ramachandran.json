    "summary": "This perspective posits that the question of consciousness cannot be solved by current neuroscience or physics, as these disciplines offer only third-person descriptions, excluding subjective experience (qualia). It calls for a new hybrid discipline of physics and neuroscience that fundamentally incorporates consciousness as a component of reality, exploring how it entwines with physical laws.",

    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (the first-person perspective) is a privileged aspect of reality that current third-person physics and neuroscience fail to admit, necessitating a new framework for its inclusion.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia, such as seeing colors, are primary sensory experiences that necessitate the proposed new hybrid discipline for explanation, as they are excluded by the third-person nature of conventional physics.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical reality (brains and laws of physics) and Consciousness/Subjective experience, which are fundamentally linked and real.",
    "epistemic_access": "Requires a shift from solely third-person description (physics) to explicitly include the first-person perspective (subjectivity).",

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "The specific dynamics are currently unknown, but the goal is to dynamically integrate consciousness into physical laws for a complete description of reality.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Consciousness is fundamentally part of reality, and its physical realization is tied to the brain, which he considers a branch of physics, requiring integration at the level of fundamental laws.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is a fundamental part of reality, and its power or function must be explored within the context of how it 'entwines with physical laws'.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Implicitly demands integration to account for cohesive 'primary sensory experience', but does not detail a specific mechanism.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The viewpoint is critical of mainstream neuroscience and physics for ignoring the problem of consciousness because it does not arise in obvious terms, leading to mainstream skepticism.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The primary limitation is that it is a foundational program rather than a complete theory; it remains unresolved precisely how consciousness should be integrated scientifically into physical laws.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within Monism, arguing that current physical ontology is incomplete due to its exclusion of subjective reality, thus requiring expansion/correction."

      "stance": "Uncertain/Conditional",
      "rationale": "The framework draws on Vedic texts, which address consciousness and may imply post-mortem existence, but the focus on developing a scientific 'new physics and neuroscience' leaves the question of biological survival conditional upon the fundamental nature of the discovered laws."
