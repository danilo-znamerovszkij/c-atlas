    "theory_title": "Deacon’s Symbolic Communication (Human Consciousness)",
    "summary": "This theory posits that human consciousness was radically altered by the emergence of symbolic communication, untethering it from physical immediacy and enabling awareness of a 'virtual realm'. This symbolic mode creates a self embedded in a physically and temporally extended shared mentality.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as a capacity for awareness of a virtual, symbolic realm, radically altered by symbolic communication, moving beyond the predictive capacity common to animal consciousness.",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism. (Inferred from classification under Materialism Theories, focusing on evolved biological and cognitive processes ).",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Symbolic communication, enabled by physical brain processes, acts as the primary mechanism that alters and structures the resulting mental life and consciousness.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent. (Consciousness arose broadly with animal brains, and human consciousness is a highly novel, later development resulting from symbolic communication ).",
    "emergence_type": "Non-Reductive Emergence. (Justification: The theory describes the *emergence of novel kinds* of remembering, emotional experience, and value. While classified as Materialism, the novelty suggests properties irreducible to lower levels, aligning with Non-Reductive Physicalism features, but staying within the Materialism umbrella as classified ).",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (self) is described as an ongoing phenomenon derived from a shared, temporally extended mentality, placing personal identity within a symbolically eusocial species structure. Intentionality is extended to abstract, virtual realms untethered from immediacy.",
    "qualia_account": "The symbolic mode of cognition enables unprecedented forms of emotional experience and value (ethical norms, aesthetic sense), suggesting that qualia are intrinsically tied to these complex, emergent symbolic structures.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Evolved human brains, symbolic structures (language), and a complex shared social mentality (\"Extended Mind\").",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible primarily through evolutionary and neuroanthropological study of symbolic communication, linguistic analysis, and the resulting shared mentality.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "Symbolic representations and the resulting 'physically and temporally extended shared mentality' , which forms a 'center of narrative gravity' for the self (if integrated with Dennett's related ideas, also classified under Materialism)."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal (altered/unprecedented forms), Self-awareness (personal identity), Agency (linked to value/ethical norms).",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Symbolic communication, which fundamentally restructures cognitive processing, allowing conscious access to a virtual realm decoupled from immediate physical reality.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Dynamic process, emerging through the co-evolutionary interaction between the brain and symbolic systems.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The human brain, but functionally distributed and extended via the structures of shared symbolic mentality.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Causes the emergence of novel kinds of remembering, unprecedented forms of emotional experience, value (ethical/aesthetic sense), and the feeling of incompleteness/need for meaning.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration leads to personal identity derived from belonging to a 'symbolically eusocial species' with a shared mentality.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information flows symbolically, granting indirect access to others’ thoughts and experiences and enabling the construction of a virtual realm of awareness.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Symbolic communication evolved, resulting in a 'radical alteration' of consciousness, moving beyond the predictive capacity afforded by long-distance senses.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Symbolic communication has radically altered the nature of human consciousness, untethering it from physical contiguity.",

    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "As a theory classified under Materialism/Representationalism, it must account for how symbolic structures generate the 'unprecedented forms of emotional experience and value' (qualia) it posits, a common hurdle for materialist explanations.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "Requires detailed explanation of how a symbolic mode of cognition specifically leads to the emergence of phenomenal qualities like aesthetic sense and ethical norms.",

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Conditional",
      "rationale": "If artificial systems can fully replicate the complex, evolved symbolic communicative capacity and consequently develop a shared/extended mentality structure similar to human symbolic eusociality, human-like consciousness is possible."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Consciousness, in this view, is fundamentally linked to the embodied biological and evolved cognitive structures supporting symbolic communication, suggesting cessation upon physical death."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Humanistic only",
      "rationale": "The symbolic mode of cognition is explicitly identified as the source of our human capacity for ethical norms, aesthetic sense, and the need to find meaning. Meaning is therefore generated by human symbolic culture and evolution, not cosmic teleology."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "If the complex symbolic processing capacity, the 'extended mind' aspects, and the resulting personal identity structure can be perfectly duplicated or uploaded to a non-biological medium, virtual immortality is theoretically attainable, consistent with the overarching Materialism category."
