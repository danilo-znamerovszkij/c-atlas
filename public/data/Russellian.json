    "summary": "Russellian Monism posits that the physical world, described by physics only in terms of structure and relations, has an intrinsic nature (quiddities) that is phenomenal or proto-phenomenal. This approach integrates consciousness into the fundamental reality while avoiding the traditional problems of dualism and reductive materialism.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness (or proto-consciousness) is the intrinsic, categorical nature or property ('quiddities' or 'inscrutables') underlying the relational structure of physical reality described by physics.",
    "ontological_status": "Neutral Monism or Physical Monism or Phenomenal Monism (variant dependent); fundamentally Monistic.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind and physical world are deeply intertwined, with mental properties constituting the intrinsic nature of fundamental physical entities (the categorical bases of physical dispositions).",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive (at the fundamental level of reality, as phenomenal or proto-phenomenal properties of micro-entities).",
    "emergence_type": "Not applicable (properties are primitive/intrinsic). The macroscopic aggregation of consciousness is sometimes characterized as a combination problem, rather than emergence.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is inherent because fundamental physical entities are infused by phenomenal properties. Detailed articulation of intentionality is not explicitly detailed in the source material for this theory.",

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness arises through the combination of fundamental phenomenal/proto-phenomenal properties. The process relies on solving the 'combination problem' of how micro-properties yield complex macro-experiences.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Located in the intrinsic properties of fundamental micro-level physical entities or potentially instantiated by the universe as a whole (priority monism).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Avoids the causal exclusion problem of dualism by embedding consciousness into the fundamental properties of the physical world, meaning consciousness underlies physical reality itself.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration must occur through a mechanism that combines microphysical phenomenal properties into complex, unified macro-experiences (the 'combination problem').",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Focuses primarily on the intrinsic nature (quiddity) underlying physical relations/structure, rather than detailing informational flow mechanisms.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The theory allows for variants where consciousness evolves from proto-phenomenal properties, particularly in consciousness evolving systems.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The primary challenge is the combination problem, which is critical: explaining how microphysical properties combine to form complex, integrated macro-level consciousness. If Panprotopsychism is assumed, it faces the problem of deriving consciousness (qualia) from proto-phenomenal properties.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The successful solution to the combination problem is necessary for the theory to become the most promising solution to the mind-body problem. The specific nature of the 'inscrutables' remains a major internal debate (Phenomenal, Protophenomenal, Physical, or Neutral).",
