    "theory_title": "Kauffman’s Mind Mediating Possibles to Actuals",
    "summary": "This theory posits that consciousness is partly quantum and acts as a necessary component to mediate the conversion of ontologically real Possibles (Res potentia) into Actuals (Res extensa) via quantum measurement. This mechanism is necessary because purely classical physics cannot account for the role of mind in collapsing the wave function, which is required to circumvent the causal closure of classical physics.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as partly quantum, enabling the conversion of ontologically real Possibles (Res potentia) into Actuals (Res extensa) during quantum measurement. This function allows the brain/mind to accomplish goal-directed perception/action.",
    "ontological_status": "Non-Substance Dualism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness entails a causal role (non-physical cause) in the physical world by converting Possibles to Actuals, necessitated by the failure of physical cause alone to perform this conversion and circumventing the causal closure of classical physics.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive/Fundamental element",
    "emergence_type": "",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity arises as the brain/mind collapses the wave function to a single state which the agent experiences as qualia. Intentionality is integral to the mechanism, allowing 'seeing' or 'perceiving' of X to accomplish Y.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia arise from the collapse of a vast superposition into a single state, fixed by the brain/mind.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Ontologically real Possibles (Res potentia) and Actuals (Res extensa), and a brain/mind that is partly quantum. The concept of potentia is drawn from Werner Heisenberg's interpretation of the quantum state.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessed through theoretical arguments based on the necessity of quantum physics to solve the problem of causal closure, and indirectly supported by empirical evidence for nonlocal experiences (psi phenomena).",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The structure consists of the relationship between Possibles (Res potentia) and Actuals (Res extensa), mediated by the non-classical physics inherent in the brain/mind system."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal (qualia), Agency, Causal Action, Non-local aspects",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The mechanism is quantum measurement, where the brain/mind entangles with a vast superposition and then collapses the wave function, converting Res potentia into Res extensa.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic process rooted in quantum interactions. The conversion of Possibles to Actuals is a fundamental dynamic event.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized to the brain/mind system but involving non-local quantum aspects that extend beyond the physical brain.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness plays an active, non-physical causal role in the physical world by performing wave function collapse. This active role is essential for agency, allowing the system to achieve Y by 'seeing' or 'perceiving' X.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved via the collapse of the vast superposition into a single, unified, conscious state.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information flow relates to the conversion of 'possible uses' (implied information) into realized outcomes (Actuals).",

      "The brain/mind must be partly quantum, as classical systems cannot analogously process 'possible uses'.",

    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "Corroboration is drawn from reported studies of psi phenomena suggesting a nonlocal mind. No specific neurobiological intervention tests associated solely with the Possibles-to-Actuals conversion mechanism are mentioned.",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Like most quantum theories of consciousness, it is often dismissed by mainstream physicists and neuroscientists who do not take quantum consciousness seriously. It relies on a non-classical interpretation of quantum mechanics and metaphysical claims about potentia.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The core question remains how the conversion of Possible to Actual occurs when 'no physical cause can convert a Possible into an Actual', implying an irreducible role for mind. The full articulation of the relationship between 'possible uses' and quantum mechanics is needed.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent within its self-defined Non-Substance Dualism, which avoids the difficulties of substance dualism (causal closure of classical physics) by making the mind integral to quantum causation."

      "stance": "Uncertain",
      "rationale": "By asserting consciousness as fundamental to reality (through potentia/actuals) and endowing it with a causal role, it steps away from the 'pointless' universe of strict materialism, implying a possible framework for ultimate meaning, though not explicitly defined."

      "stance": "Probably (with uncertainty)",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is quantum, virtual duplication is possible under predictable regularities, but the inherent indeterminacies and probabilistics of quantum physics introduce uncertainty and may undermine perfect duplicability required for virtual immortality."
