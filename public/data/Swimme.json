    "summary": "Swimme presents a cosmology of a creative universe, or cosmogenesis, where human consciousness holds an essential role . Drawing on Thomas Berry’s concept of the spirituality of the universe, this theory posits that the evolution of the universe aims toward greater complexity and consciousness, suggesting that consciousness is built into the fundamental fabric and dynamism of matter.",

    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Intentionality is cosmic, as the universe 'can intend something even before human consciousness emerges' . Human awareness is characterized as the universe reflecting on its own cosmogenesis .",
