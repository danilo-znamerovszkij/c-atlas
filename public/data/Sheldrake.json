    "summary": "This is a robust form of panpsychism positing that consciousness or 'mind-like organization' exists throughout nature, residing in all self-organizing systems, from atoms and cells to cosmological entities like the sun and galaxies. Consciousness is defined idiosyncratically as the capacity for making choices among possible future states that are not fixed.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is the intrinsic property or organization of self-organizing systems, defined by its function of enabling choice among future possibilities that are not fixed.",
    "ontological_status": "Panpsychism/Non-Dualistic Monism (Sheldrake rejects dualism and materialism but posits mind/consciousness universally as a fundamental organizational aspect).",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness and physical reality 'go hand in hand' . Electrical fields are proposed as the interface or medium mediating between physical structures and consciousness, but are not consciousness itself .",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Consciousness is pervasive/primitive, existing in systems from simple atoms upwards . However, it also forms a 'nesting of consciousnesses' at higher levels of organization .",
    "emergence_type": "Hierarchical Emergence (Nesting of Consciousnesses). Although consciousness is pervasive (panpsychism), complexity leads to a nesting of different forms of consciousness (e.g., human vs. sun consciousness) .",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Consciousness is linked to agency or 'choice,' enabling systems to hold and select from alternative future possibilities . Subjectivity is present at all levels of organization .",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (experience/awareness) exist fundamentally but are radically different for non-biological minds (like the sun's mind) compared to human consciousness .",
    "ontological_commitments": "Self-organizing systems, electrical fields as an interface, and the 'realm of possibilities' inherent in physical reality (referencing quantum indeterminacy) .",
    "epistemic_access": "Inferred through philosophical reasoning (panpsychist turn) and analogy based on the observed complexity of electrical patterns in both biological and cosmological systems (e.g., comparing brain activity to the sun's electrical activity) .",
    "constituents_and_structure": "A nesting of consciousnesses at all levels of organization, where each level is a self-organizing whole with its own kind of mind ."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Experience, awareness, agency/choice-making, and self-regulation within a complex system .",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The capacity of a system to operate in the realm of future possibilities that are not fixed. This capacity enables the system to make choices . Electrical fields are the proposed interface mediating this process .",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "A dynamic, nested process that evolves toward greater complexity . Consciousness occurs when systems display non-fixed possibilities .",
    "location_and_distribution": "Ubiquitous, present in all self-organizing systems (atoms, cells, earth, sun, galaxy, universe) .",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is functional, enabling choice and regulating the system's 'body' (self-regulation against entropy) .",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is implied by the 'nesting' of consciousnesses and the electrical fields which organize spatio-temporal patterns of activity .",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information flow is implicitly related to choice-making among possibilities, mediated by electrical fields, which act as an interface between possibilities and physical structure .",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness exists from the simplest levels (atoms) and complexity involves a nesting of consciousnesses . The entire universe’s evolution is guided, in part, by this encompassing mind .",

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Largely speculative or highly arguable for non-biological systems . The core claim is based more on philosophical analogy regarding complexity rather than direct empirical testing (Justification based on source limitations).",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Criticized for being astonishing and highly speculative, particularly in attributing mind/consciousness to cosmological systems like the sun . The extent of choice in simple systems like electrons is considered 'arguable and probably undecidable' .",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "It is difficult to imagine or conceive of these radically different forms of consciousness (like 'sun consciousness') . The degree of consciousness in fundamental particles (e.g., electrons) is unknown .",
    "ontological_coherence": "High, provided the initial premise of universal mind-like organization is accepted, as it offers a non-dualistic explanation for organization across all scales of reality ."

    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Possible",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is a general property of complex, self-organizing systems regardless of biological substrate (as exemplified by the sun having a mind), then a sufficiently complex self-organizing artificial system or network could potentially achieve consciousness ."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Likely (Non-individual component)",
      "rationale": "As a form of panpsychism, the components of consciousness are fundamental and exist universally. Individual consciousness might dissolve back into the nesting of consciousnesses or the mind-like organization of the entire universe ."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Cosmic teleology",
      "rationale": "The theory posits mind-like organization for the entire universe, suggesting this cosmic consciousness plays an important part in the universe’s evolution, implying inherent purpose or direction ."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Possible (Conditional)",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is tied to organization mediated by electrical fields . If this specific organizational pattern and the corresponding electrical field interface could be digitally or artificially reproduced, virtual continuation might be possible, assuming the underlying 'possibilities' realm is accessible."
