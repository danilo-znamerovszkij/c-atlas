    "summary": "This theory proposes a relational and realist completion of quantum theory, asserting that the universe is fundamentally constructed from a collection of 'views of events,' defined by the information available from their causal past . Consciousness is identified with the rare, specific views that are unprecedented or unique in the universal history .",

    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind (conscious perceptions/qualia) is an aspect of underlying physical reality, specifically the 'views of events,' which are the beables of the theory .",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive/Fundamental (for novel views). Consciousness is defined as a fundamental aspect of specific relational entities (views), selected by a physical principle, rather than emerging from complex physical processes .",
    "emergence_type": "Selection Principle/Fundamental Aspect. Consciousness arises not through standard accumulation, but via a physical distinction between common (routine) and novel (unique) relational states .",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "An elementary unit of consciousness is the entire partial view of the universe seen from one event (a 'momentary self') . Subjectivity is thus rooted in the unique perspectival nature of the event's causal view.",

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is associated with 'instances or moments of conscious experience' corresponding to events defined by their relational causal history .",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized to rare events whose causal views are deemed novel . The distribution follows a restricted panpsychism, where conscious aspects are not ubiquitous but limited by the selection principle .",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is an intrinsic aspect of the fundamental relational beables . Since the theory integrates qualia into physics, consciousness is causally relevant, although its precise functional role (e.g., control) is not explicitly defined in the source material .",
    "integration_or_binding": "The integration or binding problem is addressed by defining the elementary unit of consciousness as the entire partial view of the universe seen from that event .",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The complexity of defining and physically identifying 'novel' or 'unique' views of events introduces challenges. As a form of restricted panpsychism, it must reconcile the presence and absence of phenomenal properties across different types of physical events .",
