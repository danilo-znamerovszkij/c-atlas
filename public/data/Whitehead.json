    "summary": "This theory, rooted in panexperientialism, posits that fundamental reality consists of dynamic events or processes (occasions) that possess both material and mental aspects. Consciousness emerges as an achievement of the evolution of experience through a dipolar relational process, avoiding the dichotomy of traditional substance dualism or reductive materialism.",

    "ontological_status": "Neutral Monism/Panexperientialism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Dual-aspect/Process-Relational Monism. Mind and matter are two poles/aspects of the same dynamic process; matter is the stability-providing pole and mind is the novelty-inducing mental pole.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent (Consciousness) from Primitive (Panexperiential events/occasions)",
    "emergence_type": "Creative Advance/Genuine Becoming/Non-Reductive Emergence. This arises through 'concrescence' (novel togetherness) which is a cumulative, non-additive process.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Experiences are intrinsically process-relational, manifesting in a 'specious present' involving an inherited past and anticipated future forms. Subjectivity arises from the mentality inherent in fundamental occasions.",
    "qualia_account": "Conscious experience is an emergent 'creative repetition of the past' that is not reducible to its constituent parts. Qualia are inherent in the experience/mentality component of fundamental occasions.",

    "epistemic_access": "Philosophical reflection, analysis of metaphysical foundations, and analogy to energetic activity, moving beyond substantialist ontology.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "Fundamental units are dynamic events or 'occasions' placing processes of creation and extinction as core features. These occasions possess a dipolar structure (mental pole and material pole), organized by 'concrescence'."

    "causation_and_functional_role": "Mind functions as the novelty-inducing mental pole, driving 'creative advance' and genuine becoming in the relational process.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved through the 'logic of concrescence', resulting in a unified, non-additive 'novel togetherness' of the experience.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Experiences are fundamentally relational, involving the integration of 'actualized facts of an inherited past' (information) to generate the 'specious present' and potential future forms.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Whitehead's theory re-frames panpsychism's central difficulty, the combination problem, by focusing on process-relational activity (concrescence) rather than the summation of abstract mental properties.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The core problem of how attenuated mentality in elementary events (occasions) scales up to complex, unified human consciousness is reframed but remains a significant conceptual challenge.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within its own Process Philosophy framework, as it radically reforms the conception of reality to be fundamentally based on dynamic events and relations, thus inherently accommodating experience."

      "stance": "Possible/Conditional",
      "rationale": "Artificial systems capable of genuine 'concrescence'—novel becoming and creativity—might instantiate consciousness, but mere computation or simulation would likely be insufficient given the focus on dynamic, process-relational reality."

      "stance": "Likely/Conditional",
      "rationale": "The theory posits a universal soul/psyche of the cosmos (God) and frames consciousness in terms of non-material events/occasions. Individual experience is preserved as a 'creative repetition of the past' in subsequent occasions, suggesting persistence in a cosmic memory or greater whole."

      "stance": "Uncertain",
      "rationale": "Digital duplication might fail to capture the required 'genuine becoming' and creative potential inherent in concrescence, meaning a purely simulated continuation would likely lack the essential conscious characteristics."
