    "summary": "This theory speculates that consciousness originates from a fundamental, unknown aspect of reality termed 'Mental Space,' which requires accommodation by a new physics. The brain’s function is not to generate consciousness but rather to limit or filter this pre-existing, primary consciousness, a framework necessary to account for paranormal phenomena (psi).",
