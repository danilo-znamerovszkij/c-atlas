    "theory_title": "Bergson’s Multiplicity, Duration, Perception, Memory",
    "summary": "This non-reductive theory views consciousness as a dynamic, ceaselessly temporal reality, characterized by 'duration' and 'multiplicity' which is fundamentally memory. The brain does not generate consciousness, but acts as a filter, limiting overwhelming awareness to enable focused action in the world.",
    "associated_thinkers": ["Henri Bergson"],

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as 'memory taken as a whole' and a 'ceaselessly dynamic, inherently temporal substance of reality,' manifesting as a continuous movement between pure perception (images) and pure memory.",
    "ontological_status": "Frankly Dualist. Bergson affirms the reality of both matter and spirit, positing a middle ground (pure perception/images) between realism and idealism.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Interactionist/Non-reductive Correlation. The relationship is intimate, but the brain's role is strictly transmission and filtration; it does not generate the consciousness/spirit.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive/Fundamental. Consciousness is considered an existing substance ('spirit') which the brain filters, rather than something that emerges from physical processes.",
    "emergence_type": "Not Applicable. Consciousness is viewed as an existing fundamental substance/dynamic reality (spirit), not an emergent property of matter.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is rooted in 'duration,' the qualitative multiplicity that constitutes the immediate data of consciousness. Intentionality is expressed through consciousness's ability to anticipate the future via memory and enable 'free act called choice'.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualitative feeling ('what-it-is-like') is accounted for by 'multiplicity' and 'duration' as immediate, heterogeneous, and continuous data of consciousness. Matter itself is understood as 'only images,' linking phenomenal reality directly to matter.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Spirit (or human soul/mind/consciousness); Matter (as images); Pure Perception; Pure Memory; Duration (as qualitative time).",
    "epistemic_access": "Introspection (consciousness as immediate data of consciousness) and philosophical argument.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The structure of consciousness is characterized by duration and multiplicity, organized as a continuous movement between pure perception and pure memory."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Memory, Agency (choice), Self-awareness (implicitly, as consciousness is personal memory).",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The brain functions as a **filter** or **barrier** that prevents overwhelming, unfiltered consciousness from reaching personal awareness, thereby allowing focus and practical action. Consciousness operates based on duration (qualitative time).",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic, temporal flow, actively fabricating the future through choice and producing time via memory. It is defined by succession without reciprocal exteriority.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The brain (material component) is the location of the filtration mechanism and sensory/motor transmission. Consciousness itself ('spirit') is vast, swirling outside, or non-local.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness allows for a 'free act called choice' which fabricates the future and produces time. The brain’s function is to transmit perceptions to consciousness and transmit action orders back to the body.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is inherent in consciousness being 'the memory taken as a whole' and the continuous movement between pure perception and pure memory.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is handled via pure perception, where 'images are all we sense'. The brain transmits these images from organs to consciousness.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The brain's function as a filter is adaptive, enabling practical, focused action in the world by shielding personal awareness from vast, stupefying consciousness. (No explicit phylogenetic origin from non-life is provided, as consciousness is considered fundamental.)",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "The brain is a filter of consciousness, not its generator, preventing overwhelming consciousness.",
      "Consciousness is fundamentally memory and duration, operating as succession without reciprocal exteriority.",
      "Matter does not differ in nature from representation; matter is only images."

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Speculative/Conceptual. The theory, rooted in philosophical distinctions between duration and multiplicity, is primarily non-empirical and non-mechanistic, contrasting with materialist theories.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Bergson recognized the traditional theoretical difficulties of dualism. His views are a challenge to Materialism Theories. Critics of such filter/transmission models struggle to reconcile the non-generation claim with vast neuroscientific data linking consciousness content to brain activity.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The core problem remains how the brain/body (matter) and mind/spirit (consciousness) interact, and precisely how the filter mechanism functions.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent, founded on rigorous philosophical analysis designed to overcome the conceptual dead-end of metaphysical parallelism by positing duration as the core ontological property of mind."

    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is defined as non-computational spirit/memory associated with duration, which is inherently non-mechanistic. Artificial systems built on computation are unlikely to capture this fundamental temporal substance.",

    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Possible",
      "rationale": "Since the brain is a filter rather than a generator of consciousness (spirit/memory), this suggests consciousness is independent of the physical body and may persist after bodily death.",
      "justification": "Bergson's theory 'might even allow for some sort of survival after death'."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Cosmic/Existential",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is defined as a dynamic, fundamental substance ('spirit') capable of 'free act called choice,' implying intrinsic purpose beyond purely humanistic or biological constraints.",
      "justification": "Inferred from its 'frankly dualist' nature and association with spirit and choice."
    },
    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Virtual immortality relies on uploading computational or physical states. Since consciousness is non-reductive spirit/memory (pure duration) that is only filtered by the physical brain, duplicating neural states would not duplicate the conscious entity.",
      "justification": "Inferred based on the non-materialist and non-functionalist definition of consciousness."
