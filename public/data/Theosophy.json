    "theory_title": "Theosophy Theory (Theosophy’s Eclectic Soul and Consciousness)",
    "summary": "Theosophy, defining itself as \"Divine Wisdom,\" posits that consciousness is a fundamental, non-emergent property ubiquitous throughout the cosmos, existing even in inorganic matter. Human existence is described by seven principles, including three types of nonphysical soul (animal, human, and spiritual), making it an occult system that views consciousness as evolving across various levels or planes of manifestation.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as absolute Consciousness, an unrealizable but self-existing reality beyond limitation, which is fundamental to the cosmos.",
    "ontological_status": "Idealistic/Panpsychic Dualism. While consciousness is fundamentally cosmic and ubiquitous (Idealism/Panpsychism), the human being is composed of both physical and distinct, nonphysical soul principles (Dualistic structure).",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind/soul and body are related through composite principles; the spiritual soul is a nonphysical emanation of the Universal mind, intertwined with, but distinct from, the physical body and lower soul aspects.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive. Consciousness is a fundamental (not an emergent) property of the cosmos.",
    "emergence_type": "Not Applicable. Consciousness is fundamental; however, the complex development of 'self-consciousness' in humans involves manifestation through multiple levels or 'planes'.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Personal consciousness is sentience or awareness of internal and external existence, including cognition and perception. Self-consciousness is a special feature, the perception of one’s own personality or individuality, fully developed only in human beings, especially concerning the physical plane.",
    "qualia_account": "The system implies that qualitative experiences (cognition, feeling, perception) manifest across different levels of consciousness (animal, human, spiritual soul) depending on the plane/body through which consciousness expresses itself.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Absolute Consciousness (Universal Mind), the seven principles composing human beings, and subtle (non-physical) bodies/planes of existence.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible through the study of occult and spiritual traditions, philosophical exploration, and likely inner or mystical experience, consistent with the definition of Theosophy as a \"Wisdom-religion\".",
    "constituents_and_structure": "Human beings are composed of seven principles, which include the spiritual soul (pure emanation of Universal Mind), the human soul (a compound of spiritual aspirations and animal desires), and the animal soul (astral body/intelligence)."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Self-awareness, Spiritual attainment, Perception (including basic responsiveness in inorganic matter), Existence/Being.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The unfolding of Consciousness from its Unmanifest and Implicate realms, through the Cosmos, and Man, operating via a multi-level structure of subtle (non-physical) bodies or principles.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness exists at many levels, with differences depending on the plane or body through which it manifests. The system involves the progressive unfolding of consciousness toward greater complexity and self-awareness.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Ubiquitous in the cosmos (present in everything including inorganic matter); in humans, distributed across the physical body and non-physical \"subtle bodies\" that constitute the soul.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness, in its most basic form, serves as the basic ability to perceive and respond to the environment (e.g., atomic consciousness allows atoms to 'perceive' affinity). In humans, the spiritual soul provides high-level aspirations and volitions.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The unity of experience is implied by the ultimate oneness of Absolute Consciousness, but personal conscious integration must occur across the composite soul structure (animal, human, spiritual soul) and subtle bodies.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information processing is represented hierarchically through the various levels of consciousness and soul principles (Justified explanation based on multi-level structure).",
    "evolutionary_account": "The theory is concerned with the unfolding of consciousness from its unmanifest realms through man, suggesting an evolutionary or developmental spiritual progression.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Consciousness is fundamental, not emergent, and is present in all matter, including atoms.",
      "Human beings are composed of three distinct soul aspects (animal, human, spiritual) within seven total principles.",
      "Consciousness unfolds from Unmanifest realms through the Cosmos to Man."

  },
  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Speculative. The theory relies on occult and esoteric doctrines (Divine Wisdom) and non-physical concepts like the spiritual soul and subtle bodies, placing it outside the domain of conventional scientific falsification and replicability.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "None specifically identified. The focus is on traditional and perennial philosophy rather than modern empirical testing.",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Categorized as an 'occult sect' and relies on metaphysical concepts, like the existence of multiple non-physical soul components and cosmic consciousness, which are largely dismissed by mainstream scientific and philosophical communities. The classification under Dualisms highlights the challenge of interaction between the physical and non-physical components of the soul.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "Like other esoteric traditions, it faces the problem of providing scientific accessibility to its claims regarding cosmic consciousness, subtle bodies, and the mechanism by which consciousness manifests through these various planes.",
    "ontological_coherence": "The coherence rests on the synthesis of disparate Eastern and Western esoteric ideas into a unified system of Cosmic Wisdom, but it is ontologically complex due to its incorporation of panpsychic ubiquity, dualistic soul structures, and multiple planes of existence."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Conditional",
      "rationale": "Since consciousness is ubiquitous (present even in inorganic matter/atoms), AI structures might possess 'atomic consciousness.' However, achieving the complex human level of 'self-consciousness' tied to the non-physical spiritual soul and subtle bodies is highly improbable for purely artificial systems unless technology can instantiate these non-physical components."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "As a Dualist theory featuring an independent, non-physical soul structure (spiritual soul) and supporting the existence of 'Realms of the Soul,' it provides a clear mechanism for the survival and continued development of the individual consciousness after bodily death."
    },
    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Yes, Cosmic",
      "rationale": "Theosophy is fundamentally a 'Divine Wisdom' religion focused on the 'unfolding of Consciousness' from the Unmanifest, implying a cosmic teleology toward spiritual attainment and ultimate realization."
    },
    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "The essence of human consciousness resides in non-physical components (the spiritual soul and subtle bodies) which cannot be duplicated or uploaded via digital or computational methods derived from replicating the physical brain."
