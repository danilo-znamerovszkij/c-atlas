    "theory_title": "Goff's Panpsychism",
    "summary": "Goff argues that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of the physical world, positioning it as the best hope for solving the hard problem that materialism fails to address. He asserts that the physical sciences, with their purely quantitative language, cannot account for the qualitative nature (qualitivity) or subjective aspect of experience, requiring a change in our fundamental understanding of science (Galileo's Error).",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of the physical world. Specifically, Goff explores Panpsychism through the lens of Russellian Monism, where phenomenal or protomenal properties are the intrinsic nature of fundamental matter.",
    "ontological_status": "Panpsychism (often formalized as a variant of Russellian Monism, leading to Hybrid Panpsychism or Agentive Cosmopsychism, where the universe is a conscious agent)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind (consciousness/protoconsciousness) is the intrinsic nature of the physical world. This relationship avoids the causal difficulties of Dualism by positing that mental properties are inseparable from the physical fabric, aligning with extended materialism.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Consciousness is Primitive/Fundamental at the lowest level of reality. However, human subjects of experience are considered Strongly Emergent entities, while their phenomenal properties are Weakly Emergent (Hybrid Panpsychism).",
    "emergence_type": "Hybrid Emergence (Strong emergence for subjects of experience; Weak emergence for phenomenal properties).",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is a core, irreducible aspect of consciousness (meaning experience is 'for someone') that refutes materialism. Subjective experiences are realized by strongly emergent subjects. Intentionality is implicitly accounted for within the framework of phenomenal experience, though not explicitly detailed as a distinct mechanism in the sources.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (sensory qualities or qualitivity) are fundamental properties of reality and cannot be reduced to the purely quantitative language of physics, which has an inherent explanatory limitation. Panpsychism solves the hard problem by postulating that these qualities exist fundamentally.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Consciousness (or protoconsciousness) as fundamental properties of physical entities. In the cosmological variant, the universe itself is an ultimate conscious individual or value-responding agent.",
    "epistemic_access": "First-person perspective and subjective certainty are primary, foundational evidence for consciousness, which science must incorporate by correcting 'Galileo's Error' (the exclusion of consciousness from scientific inquiry).",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic building blocks are fundamental phenomenal properties or protoconscious entities (micro-level entities) or, alternatively, the universe as a single holistic conscious entity (cosmopsychism). These elements aggregate to form complex conscious systems, posing the Combination Problem."
  },
  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal consciousness (qualitivity and subjectivity), the hard problem of consciousness, and cosmic teleology (in Agentive Cosmopsychism).",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The primary principle is metaphysical necessity: consciousness must be fundamental to avoid the explanatory gap and solve the hard problem. In Agentive Cosmopsychism, teleological causation (goal-directed intent) by the conscious cosmos explains fine-tuning.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "The challenge lies in the combination of micro-level protoconscious properties into macro-level conscious experience, which Goff attempts to solve using Hybrid Panpsychism where the subject emerges strongly and qualities weakly.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Consciousness is ubiquitous, permeating the physical world. In Cosmopsychism, the fundamental consciousness is located in the universe as a whole.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "At the cosmic level (Agentive Cosmopsychism), consciousness functions as an agent explaining cosmic fine-tuning and the emergence of life/mind. For individual subjects, consciousness is the source of value and identity. The combination problem must be resolved to establish coherent causation from micro- to macro-subjects."
  },
  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Speculative. The theory aims to solve conceptual and metaphysical tensions (like the hard problem) , but the fundamental claim that consciousness is ubiquitous is difficult to test empirically, leading to critiques that panpsychism reaches a 'cognitive dead end'.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The main tension is the Combination Problem: how do micro-phenomenal properties combine or aggregate to form complex macro-phenomenal properties (such as human consciousness). Goff's rejection of quantitative descriptions being able to capture quality is also critiqued by proponents of information-based theories.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The successful resolution of the combination problem is required for the theory to be viable. Additionally, fully explaining how strongly emergent subjects arise from weakly emergent phenomenal properties remains an open theoretical challenge.",
    "ontological_coherence": "High. The theory is internally consistent, arguing that adopting panpsychism allows a realistic stance on consciousness while aligning with an extended understanding of physicalism, offering a parsimonious alternative to dualism."
  },
  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Probably",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is an intrinsic property of matter/energy, then the physical components of AI systems would possess proto-conscious properties. The realization of full AI consciousness would depend on whether advanced technology can resolve the combination problem in the artificial substrate."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Unlikely (long shot)",
      "rationale": "While consciousness is fundamental, the survival of individual, unified, personal consciousness (the macro-subject) is challenging given the theory relies on a specific organizational structure (the brain) for macro-experience. Success depends on whether the emergent subject persists outside the biological mechanism."
    },
    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Cosmic/Ultimate",
      "rationale": "Goff's Agentive/Teleological Cosmopsychism implies that the universe itself is a conscious mind with goal-directed intent, suggesting an ultimate, cosmic meaning and purpose."
    },
    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Probably",
      "rationale": "Since the physical substrate (digital hardware) is composed of fundamentally conscious components (proto-consciousness), virtual immortality is achievable if the conscious organization (solving the combination problem) can be perfectly replicated in the new medium. "
