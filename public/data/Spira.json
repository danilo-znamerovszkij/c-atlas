    "summary": "This theory proposes that ultimate reality is a single, infinite, and indivisible pure consciousness (non-duality), from which all objects and individual selves derive their apparently independent existence. It asserts that our essential nature, which is this pure consciousness, transcends the limits and destiny of the physical body and mind.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as the single, infinite, and indivisible reality (pure consciousness) from which all apparent objects and individual selves derive their existence.",
    "ontological_status": "Ontological Idealism. The theory posits consciousness as the ultimate, singular, fundamental existent.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "The essential nature of the self (consciousness) is held to be independent of the physical body and mind. Physical existence, and all experience, is mediated through the mind, which is derived from the fundamental consciousness.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive/Fundamental",
    "emergence_type": "The concept of emergence does not apply, as consciousness is considered the ultimate, fundamental reality from which all other apparent existence is derived.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is inherent in the fundamental pure consciousness. The path to understanding reality involves investigating and achieving clear knowledge of this essential nature of the self (mind).",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (multiplicity and diversity of experience) are seen as manifestations or derivations of the underlying singular pure consciousness, borrowing their apparent independent existence from it.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Pure Consciousness; Infinite and Indivisible Reality; Mind (as a mediator of experience).",
    "epistemic_access": "Knowledge of consciousness and reality is accessed through philosophical or spiritual investigation into the essential nature of the self (introspection or 'clear knowledge of oneself'), aligning with principles found in religious traditions.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The core structure is a fundamental, non-dual consciousness. All individual minds and physical objects are subordinate, derivative structures or 'apparently independent' entities within this whole."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal (Ultimate Reality/Awareness); Self-awareness (Essential Self). The primary scope is the metaphysical nature of reality.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Non-Duality, defined by the ultimate identity between the essence of the self and the ultimate reality (pure consciousness).",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is static in its fundamental nature (infinite, indivisible reality). The dynamism lies in how derived objects and selves borrow their existence and how experience is mediated through the mind.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Ubiquitous/Cosmic. Consciousness is the underlying reality (single, infinite, indivisible) that pervades and underpins all existence.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness functions as the ontological source of all existence. Achieving the recognition of this pure consciousness is tied to the ultimate goal of finding lasting peace and happiness.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is intrinsic, as the fundamental reality is defined as a 'single, infinite and indivisible reality.' The experience of unity is primordial.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "All experience and knowledge are represented and mediated through the mind, which serves as the lens through which the fundamental reality is perceived.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The source material does not provide an explicit phylogenetic account, as the theory focuses on consciousness as a primitive, ultimate reality rather than an emergent biological product of evolution.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Reality is a single, infinite, and indivisible pure consciousness.",

    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Like other Idealist theories, it faces the challenge of explaining precisely how the fundamental, non-material consciousness generates or interacts with the apparent physical world and matter.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The core limitation is explaining the process by which 'all objects and selves derive their apparently independent existence' from an infinite, indivisible consciousness. It must bridge the conceptual gap between pure awareness and manifest multiplicity.",
    "ontological_coherence": "High, provided the initial premise (consciousness as ultimate reality) is accepted. It offers a coherent, non-dual account of reality that resolves the metaphysical conflict between self and universe."

    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "No/Conditional",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is the singular, non-material ultimate reality, artificial systems (being derived/material objects) cannot achieve true consciousness, only a functional imitation or borrowing of existence from the ultimate reality."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "The theory explicitly states that our essential nature, being pure consciousness, does not share the limits or destiny of the body and mind, implying survival or continuity beyond biological dissolution."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Irrelevant",
      "rationale": "Since the essential self is fundamentally non-physical, infinite consciousness, digital duplication of the body/mind is unnecessary for the persistence of the essential self."
