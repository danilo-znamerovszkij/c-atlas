    "theory_title": "McFadden’s Conscious Electromagnetic Information Theory",
    "summary": "This theory proposes that the substrate of consciousness is the brain’s electromagnetic (EM) field, not neuronal matter, and that EM fields solve the binding problem by inherently integrating information spatially. Consciousness is defined as physically integrated and causally active information encoded in this global field.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is physically integrated, causally active information encoded in the brain’s global electromagnetic (EM) field, implemented as algorithms operating in space.",
    "ontological_status": "Scientific Dualism (rooted in the difference between matter and energy, but classified under Materialism)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness (EM field) is generated by the physical brain (neuronal matter), but is ontologically distinct as an energy field; thus, it is a scientific dualism rooted in the difference between matter and energy.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Strong Emergence (Justification: The theory describes consciousness as an emergent energy field with distinct causal properties—physically integrated information—that cannot be reduced to the neural matter that generates it, suggesting irreducibility in principle.)",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is implicit in the nature of consciousness as integrated (gestalt) information generated by the EM field, which allows the system to generate thoughts and report them to the outside world.",
    "qualia_account": "The theory addresses qualia by asserting that the EM field provides the intrinsic, spatially integrated basis for consciousness that accounts for phenomenal experience and resolves the binding problem.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Neuronal matter, electromagnetic (EM) fields, physically integrated information.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible via external observation of objective criteria for conscious EM fields (generating gestalt information) and empirically through correlates like EEG detection of electric fields related to consciousness.",

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal (qualia/binding), Information Integration, Conscious Causal Action, Report/Communication.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The EM field acts as the instantaneous spatial substrate for consciousness, allowing information to be integrated across space, distinguishing it from conventional temporal integration found in typical neural processing or computing.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic process implemented through algorithms that operate in space within the EM field, rather than time, allowing the system to generate integrated information.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The brain’s global electromagnetic (EM) field, acting as the brain's global workspace.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Causally active, acting as the brain's global workspace to generate gestalt information that is then communicated externally via a motor system.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Solves the binding problem by achieving physically integrated information across space via the EM field, unlike neural theories which rely on integration merely implemented in time.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information flows through the EM field, where it is encoded as physically integrated information. Stability of working memory content is hypothesized to reside primarily in the electric fields.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The theory focuses on mechanism, not phylogeny. (Justification: While placed within Materialism/Electromagnetic Field theories, the mechanism described is purely physical and localized to the brain's current function, without specifying the origin or adaptive development of the EM field mechanism itself.)",

      "Correlation studies between working memory content stability and the brain's electric fields (EEG)"
    ],
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "EMF theories remain controversial and are often overlooked by many neurobiologists and philosophers. Critics question whether EM fields alone possess the necessary complexity to account for phenomenal consciousness.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The extent to which EM fields are truly causative, rather than merely correlative, remains an open question.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Consistent with an extended physicalist ontology that grants physical status and causal power to energy fields distinct from matter (Scientific Dualism)."

    "AI_consciousness": {

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "No (Conditional on EM field persistence)",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is an emergent field property of the biological brain. Its persistence beyond death requires the maintenance or reconstitution of the EM field structure, which is reliant on underlying physical activity."

      "stance": "Unspecified/Humanistic",
      "rationale": "The focus is on the physical mechanism and substrate (EM field/information) required for experience, offering no intrinsic cosmic meaning or teleology beyond the system's operational function. (Inferred rationale.)"

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "Since consciousness is defined as information encoded in a field and not purely neuronal processes, digital duplication or transfer to non-biological hardware capable of hosting the necessary EM field structure and spatial processing dynamics should be possible in principle."
