    "summary": "This category collects diverse, speculative consciousness-first models asserting that ultimate reality is singular, fundamental consciousness, sometimes termed the “Urgrund,” which generates perceived physical reality. These models often originate from unsolicited proposals, emphasizing that individual consciousnesses are local individuations of this universal mind.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is the singular fundamental existent, such as the “Urgrund” (fundamental essence of existence) or an “infinite ocean of consciousness.” In this view, consciousness alone is the “stuff” of creation, from which matter, energy, time, and space are derived.",
    "ontological_status": "Ontological Idealism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "The physical world, including brains and spacetime, is derivative, an appearance, or a generative product of the fundamental consciousness. In the Flip-Book Idealism (FBI) model, spacetime is a set of rules adhered to by consciousness when creating experiential frames.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive/Fundamental",
    "emergence_type": "",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is an individuation or “local snapshot” of the ultimate consciousness. For C-Pattern Theory, we are consciousness itself, and the unique perspectives arise because different organisms have different c-patterns and levels of understanding reality.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are generated as frames of experience when individuated consciousness (observer/participants) translates complex signal patterns from the Urgrund (FBI). Experiences are qualitatively different from matter (C-Pattern Theory).",
    "ontological_commitments": "A singular fundamental consciousness (Urgrund); existence of consciousness outside of spacetime; reality ultimately being mind or awareness.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessed through perception and introspection (local snapshots) of individuated consciousness. For the C-Pattern Theory, consciousness is what is having all experiences.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "Consciousness exists outside of spacetime. In the C-Pattern Theory, the brain generates c-patterns (complex geometric three-dimensional structures of neural firing) which encode experience in a universal geometric language."
  },
  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Subjectivity, Ultimate Reality",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The process of individuation or dissociation of the ultimate consciousness into localized observer/participants. Specific models include Flip-Book Idealism (FBI), where the generation of experiential frames by consciousness creates the arrow of time, and Rodrigues’s C-Pattern Theory, where c-patterns generated by the brain are 'read' and converted to experiences by the universe.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is primordial and fundamental. Individual conscious experience arises dynamically through the generation of experiential frames (FBI) or through the conversion of c-patterns (C-Pattern Theory).",
    "location_and_distribution": "Everywhere/Spaceless (consciousness is the singular fundamental existent).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness, as the source and origin of existence, explains everything by itself, needing no outside explanation. Individuated consciousness (observer/participants) detects patterns in the Urgrund and shapes them into qualia.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is inherent, as all individual consciousness is ultimately one unitary consciousness or existence. In FBI, conscious agents primarily interact with one another through the intermediary of the Urgrund.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Individuated consciousness detects complex signal patterns in the Urgrund and translates them into qualia frames. C-patterns encode experiences as discrete expressions of a universal geometric experience language.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Spacetime is regarded as a set of rules consciousness must adhere to when creating experiential frames to maintain a consistent experienced world (FBI).",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Consciousness is fundamental and exists outside of space and time.",
      "The generation of experiential frames by consciousness creates the arrow of time (Flip-Book Idealism).",

    "testability_status": "Highly speculative/Philosophical, although proponents of C-Pattern Theory believe their hypothesis can be tested.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "These imaginative theories are largely dismissed by the scientific and philosophical communities. Idealism faces the challenge of explaining how the physical world arises from consciousness (the inverse hard problem) and reconciling the existence of distinct inner lives within a fundamentally unitary phenomenal field (decomposition problem).",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "Flip-Book Idealism acknowledges that it does not solve the hard problem of consciousness. Idealism must reconcile why we inhabit a common external world that unfolds independently of our personal volition.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent within the Idealist ontology, but radically opposed to Materialism."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is the ultimate reality, survival beyond death is possible. This usually involves the individual consciousness being absorbed into or diffused back into the cosmic consciousness, blurring or banishing first-person identity."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Ultimate/Cosmic",
      "rationale": "As consciousness is posited as the fundamental essence of existence, the ontology inherently provides ultimate meaning and purpose."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "Since consciousness is fundamental, hyper-technology could manipulate the conscious essence to preserve the unique pattern of the mental self, assuming the pattern can be preserved or recreated."
