    "summary": "Phenomenal consciousness is the representational content generated by a cognitive system’s sufficiently structured representational processing. This content is fundamentally subjective and its basic elements possess irreducible qualitative character, arising from the finite nature of a self-reflective cognitive system.",

    "ontological_status": "Materialism/Physicalism. Consciousness is a strictly physical phenomenon instantiated by the brain.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Identity theory, asserting that consciousness is identical to the representational content arising from structured physical processing in the brain.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence (Inferred, as the theory aligns with a naturalistic, materialist worldview where consciousness is a strictly physical phenomenon instantiated by the brain, suggesting that although the resultant properties are complex, they arise wholly from physical processes.)",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Conscious experience is categorically subjective, existing only for the conscious system. Subjectivity is partially explained because representational content is generally not found in the external world it represents.",
    "qualia_account": "The basic elements are irreducibly qualitative. Qualia are identified as 'epistemic primitives' that resist further representation on pain of metabolically expensive representational regress, thereby accounting for their non-decomposable, monadic character (the ‘untranscendable object’ concept).",
    "ontological_commitments": "Cognitive systems, structured representational processing, and physical instantiation in the brain.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible through introspective report, potentially verifiable through future developments in the science of representation and representational content.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The structure of consciousness is based on the sufficiently structured representational processing of the cognitive system, composed of representational content that includes epistemic primitives.",
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Subjectivity, Self-reflection (First-person perspective)",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The phenomenal experience is generated by the representational content itself, grounded in the system’s necessity to employ 'epistemic primitives' (untranscendable objects) to avoid infinite regress.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness arises from the physical workings of the brain as a necessary outcome of a sufficiently complex, self-reflective cognitive system.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized within the cognitive system (brain) capable of sufficient structured representational processing.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness provides the system with subjective existence and self-reflective capacity. A specific functional role (e.g., control, selection) is not explicitly detailed, as the focus is primarily ontological (what consciousness is).",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is implied by the unified, monadic, and non-decomposable nature of basic sensory qualities/epistemic primitives within the conscious system.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information flow is central, as consciousness is the representational content resulting from representational processing.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The theory is framed within naturalism and materialism, implying that consciousness evolved as a strictly physical phenomenon instantiated by the brain (Inferred from categorization and worldview stance).",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Phenomenal consciousness is the representational content of a cognitive system’s sufficiently structured processing.",

      "stance": "Generic Continuity",
      "rationale": "The consciousness of the individual person ends with the brain's death because consciousness is a physical phenomenon instantiated by the brain.
