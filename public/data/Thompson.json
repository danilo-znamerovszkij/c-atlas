    "theory_title": "Thompson’s Mind in Life",
    "summary": "This theory posits a deep continuity between life and mind, claiming that the self-organizing, self-producing features of biological life (autopoiesis) are the foundation for cognition. Mind is understood as an enriched, sentient version of these fundamental organizational properties, situated dynamically across the body and environment, not just the brain.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as the enriched, self-organizing dynamic features of life (sentience) that are embodied and situated in the world.",
    "ontological_status": "Naturalistic Physicalism (Embodied/Enactive focus)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mental life is bodily life, implying a deep ontological continuity where the mind ramifies through the body and environment and is not reducible simply to brain processes inside the head.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Emergent (Non-Reductive/Non-Hierarchical). Mind emerges as an enriched version of the self-organizing features of life, without seeking reductive closure of the explanatory gap.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (selfhood) is explicated from the ground up by accounting for the autonomy proper to living and cognitive beings. Intentionality arises from self-organized compensations triggered by perturbations, rather than representations of external states.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are tied to the self-organizing dynamics of action, perception, and emotion, necessitating richer phenomenological accounts of the structure of lived experience to address the explanatory gap.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Self-organizing features of life, autopoietic organization, dynamic systems equations, and lived experience (phenomenology).",
    "epistemic_access": "Requires scientific accounts of mind and life to be informed by richer phenomenological accounts of lived experience (naturalized phenomenology).",
    "constituents_and_structure": "A core set of formal or organizational properties shared by life and mind; characterized by dynamic systems that describe state changes over time as trajectories in a state space."

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic and intrinsically temporal phenomenon, where conscious states are generated by self-organized compensations following perturbations to the system’s intrinsic dynamics.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The mind is distributed and situated, with its roots ramifying through the body and environment, rather than being confined solely to the brain.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is crucial for the autonomy of living beings and involves self-organized compensations necessary for maintaining integrity against external disturbances.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Achieved through the intrinsic unity and self-producing (autopoietic) organization of the living system, which implies a unified concept of 'life-mind'. (Specific neural binding mechanism not provided in source.)",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Inputs are conceptualized as perturbations to the system’s intrinsic dynamics, rather than as instructions to be followed or internal representations of external states of affairs.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness emerged as an enriched version of life's fundamental self-organizing properties, suggesting continuity where the transition from nonlife to life enabled the transition from life to mind.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Life and mind share a core set of formal or organizational properties.",
      "Mental life is embodied and situated, extending beyond brain processes inside the head.",

    "testability_status": "Conceptually testable and empirically informed; relies on aligning scientific accounts (like dynamic systems models) with phenomenological accounts.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Criticized by strict reductionists for failing to achieve a reductive closure of the explanatory gap; faces the philosophical challenge of naturalizing rich phenomenology (lived experience) into a scientific framework.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "Does not aim to close the explanatory gap in a reductive sense, but rather to enrich resources for addressing it. The need for richer phenomenological accounts is a key requirement.",
    "ontological_coherence": "High. The theory is internally consistent within its framework of embodied dynamism and continuous life-mind organization, serving as a pillar of the Embodied and Enactive category."

      "stance": "Unlikely",
      "rationale": "Mind is non-reducible to brain processes and computation alone (as input is perturbation, not instruction). Duplicating the self-producing, deeply embodied 'life-mind' organization in a digital substrate would likely be impossible."
