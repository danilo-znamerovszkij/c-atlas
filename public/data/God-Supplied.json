    "summary": "This theory asserts that consciousness is a nonphysical substance (the soul or spirit) that is imparted or supplied directly to each individual by God, independent of purely material processes. This theological dualism holds that the soul constitutes the essential conscious self and grounds personal identity.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as a wholly immaterial, substantial soul (self, ego, I), separate from the physical body, supplied by God.",
    "ontological_status": "Substance Dualism (Theistic/Theological)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Interactionist/Creationist Dualism, where the immaterial soul, created by God, interacts with the physical brain/body (e.g., dualist-interactionism).",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive",
    "emergence_type": "N/A",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is inherent to the immaterial substance (the soul), which grounds personal identity. The soul's unified reality accounts for intentionality and unified awareness.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia reside in the nonphysical substance/soul; qualitative experience is an intrinsic property of the immaterial conscious substance, irreducible to physical processes.",
    "ontological_commitments": "God, nonphysical substance (soul/spirit), and the physical brain/body.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessed through first-person introspection and philosophical arguments defending the existence of an independent, unified substantial self.",

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Static/Supplied (Consciousness is instantiated by divine act, not arising dynamically from physical matter).",
    "location_and_distribution": "Nonphysical, but associated with the physical body during life. The soul/spirit is fully 'present' throughout the body, providing the principle of animation and form.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The soul informs, animates, and guides the body. It is the locus of unified awareness and, in interactionist versions, exerts causal power (top-down causation) on the physical system.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Unity is fundamentally achieved by the substantial, unified nature of the soul itself, which prevents conscious experience from being reducible to an aggregate of separable physical parts.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information processing in the brain is required for sensory input and output, but the resulting phenomenal content is hosted by the nonphysical soul.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Not applicable; this theory operates outside the framework of evolutionary emergence from non-conscious matter, viewing consciousness as divinely provided.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Consciousness is a nonphysical substance (soul) supplied directly by God.",
      "The soul grounds personal identity and the unified nature of awareness, which materialism struggles to explain.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Faces the classic interaction problem: explaining how an immaterial substance can causally interact with a physical brain. It is also criticized for violating Occam's razor by postulating a second substance.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The mechanism by which God determines which specific individual consciousness (soul) is allocated to which body, and how interaction occurs without violating the causal closure of physics, remains unresolved.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent within robust theistic substance dualism, but fundamentally incompatible with physicalist and materialist frameworks that deny the existence of nonphysical substances."

    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "No (Mostly)",
      "rationale": "If consciousness requires a radically separate, nonphysical substance (soul) supplied by God, it is impossible for human technology to produce or allocate this substance to artificial intelligences."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "Dualism provides the clearest mechanism for survival because the nonphysical soul or spirit, the 'real self,' exists independently of the physical body."

      "stance": "No",
