    "summary": "This approach to consciousness suggests that understanding the brain requires developing and implementing an appropriate collection of models that link lower-level properties to higher-level phenomenology. It is significantly influenced by the potential reality of psi phenomena, which implies the necessity of new dimensions of reality or new biological principles beyond those currently acknowledged in physics to explain consciousness.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is characterized as a higher-level property that fits into how organisms deal with information, potentially mediated by a 'biological field' and explained through inferences based on a series of appropriate models that link brain activity to phenomenology.",
    "ontological_status": "Extended Physicalism / Monism. The framework is not purely materialistic, positing the likely need to include 'new dimensions of reality' and 'biological principles' that current physics does not contain.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness is fundamentally linked to biology, suggesting principles that unfold in dramatic ways beyond classical physical laws. This connection is explored through models that relate brain activity and behavior to higher-level mental properties.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Strong Emergence (Conditional). The reliance on new, currently unknown biological principles to explain consciousness implies properties not derivable even in principle from known fundamental physics, fitting the criterion for strong emergence.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (phenomenology) is a higher-level property requiring explanation via models. Intentionality is incorporated as 'goal-directedness,' which plays an important role in the underlying organizational paradigm, contrasting with the conventional view of a meaningless universe.",
    "qualia_account": "Phenomenology is treated as a 'higher-level property' requiring explanation by the collection of appropriate models, rather than being fundamentally reducible to lower-level brain components alone.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Quantum physics, an appropriate collection of models, goal-directed agencies, new dimensions of reality, and emergent biological fields.",
    "epistemic_access": "Consciousness is accessed and understood primarily through the construction and implementation of various models, informed by evidence of anomalous cognition (psi phenomena) and philosophical considerations about the limits of conventional physics.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "An 'evolving ensemble of experts [modules]' acting in harmony, where consciousness fits into the way organisms process information, possibly involving quantum physics or a biological field."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, higher-level properties, teleological goal-directedness.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle that biological and conscious processes are guided by mechanisms outside conventional physics (new dimensions, unknown biological principles) suggested by the potential reality of psi phenomena ('spooky actions at a distance'). Core mechanism involves organization and goal-directedness in modular systems.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic process arising through the dramatic unfolding of biological principles, viewed within a 'theory of everything' paradigm focused on synergetic patterns and evolving modular systems.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized in the brain (linked to lower-level processes) but requiring external or non-local connections, such as 'new dimensions of reality' or a 'biological field'.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Goal-directedness has an important role in shaping physical processes, suggesting mental causation (e.g., in ensemble music performance via telepathy). Consciousness is viewed as potentially playing a role in the universe's ultimate structure by contributing to the creation of observed reality.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved by the harmonious action of an 'evolving ensemble of experts [modules]'. Psi phenomena offer examples of coherence, such as musicians 'locking into a single state' through telepathy.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Organisms deal with information in a certain way, and consciousness fits into this system. This suggests information processing guided by non-physical or non-conventional physical constraints.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness is seen as fundamentally linked to biology, arising from principles that unfold during evolution. The theory suggests the universe itself is the product of agencies that use 'evolved technologies' for specific purposes.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Understanding higher-level properties like phenomenology requires a collection of models based on lower-level brain/behavior aspects.",
      "The potential existence of psi phenomena (e.g., telepathy) indicates that physics needs to include new dimensions of reality.",
      "Consciousness is linked to the emergence of goal-directed organization in an 'evolving ensemble of experts' (modules)."

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Empirically testable in principle, contingent on accepting and verifying psi phenomena and developing experimental paradigms to explore the proposed biological fields or new dimensions.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "Studies concerning psi phenomena, particularly instances like telepathy in ensemble performance, are used as evidence supporting the conceptual need for the theory.",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The reliance on psi phenomena leads to rejection by mainstream science, which attributes such ideas to speculation and challenges due to social pressures and career concerns. The theory requires an extension of fundamental physics that many reject.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise nature of the hypothesized 'new dimensions of reality' remains speculative. The mechanism and characteristics of the proposed 'biological field' are undefined within the source material.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Consistent with ontological positions that allow for extensions of physical reality (e.g., Dual-Aspect Monism or specific Quantum Theories), but fundamentally incoherent with strict reductive materialism."

      "stance": "Possible",
      "rationale": "The theory is part of the 'Anomalous and Altered States Theories' category, which often envisions an expanded reality or state of consciousness after death. The speculation about a consciousness 'behind the universe on a larger, possibly infinite scale' supports this possibility."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Cosmic",
      "rationale": "The theory proposes a universe that is not meaningless, arguing that 'goal-directedness has an important role to play' and suggesting the universe may be the product of agencies acting to suit particular purposes."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Uncertain",
      "rationale": "If consciousness relies on non-local quantum processes or dimensions beyond current physics (new biological principles or a biological field), it is currently unknowable whether advanced technology could manipulate or duplicate these non-reducible causes to achieve virtual uploading."
