    "summary": "This theory proposes that consciousness is a two-tiered system derived fundamentally from physiology and stored as cellular physiologic data within and between cells. It suggests that consciousness operates based on principles of classical physics and quantum mechanics, linking local consciousness via quantum entanglement to a non-local cosmic consciousness.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as stored cellular physiologic memory and data (derived from the First Principles of Physiology: negative entropy, chemiosmosis, and homeostasis), retrieved by the central nervous system (CNS) as an algorithm for thought.",
    "ontological_status": "Extended Physicalism/Quantum Monism. The theory blends classical Newtonian and quantum mechanical principles, integrating consciousness as an intrinsic property integral to physiology and continuous with the Cosmos.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind (consciousness) is derivative from physiology (cell biology) and stored within and between cells. This link is bridged at a fundamental level by quantum entanglement, which connects the local physical state to non-local cosmic consciousness.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent. Consciousness is described as having been 'constructed' from the environment via symbiogenesis, integrating factors into cell physiology.",
    "emergence_type": "Strong/Radical Emergence. Justification: Consciousness includes non-local properties and is linked to cosmic consciousness via quantum entanglement, suggesting properties not reducible to classical micro-level physics alone.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Consciousness serves as the 'algorithm' for translating local and non-local cellular physiologic memories into thought. This suggests intentionality arises through the organized retrieval and processing of these memories by the CNS. Explicit detail on first-person subjectivity (qualia) is limited in the source.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are implied to arise from the translation and integration of complex local and non-local cellular physiologic memories (data) into thought via the central nervous system algorithm.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physiology (cells, membranes, CNS), classical Newtonian and quantum mechanical principles, quantum entanglement, local and non-local memories, cosmic consciousness.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessed via the central nervous system (retrieval mechanism). Also accessible through altered states such as lucid dreaming, near-death experiences (NDEs), out-of-body experiences (OBEs), Maslow peak experiences, and runner's high, which are seen as attaining a transcendent level of consciousness.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "A two-tiered structure: 1) the cell semi-permeable membrane; and 2) the compartmentation and integration of cell physiologic data as cell-cell communication. The cell acts like a functional Mobius Strip, continuously linked to the Cosmos."

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Quantum entanglement integral to physiology, linking local cellular memory (derived from physiological control mechanisms like homeostasis and negative entropy) with non-local cosmic consciousness, and retrieved by the CNS as an algorithm.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic continuum of local and non-local properties. It arises via symbiogenesis. Evolutionarily, organisms move closer to the non-local state by transcending the local.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Located locally within and between cells, based on the cell semi-permeable membrane and cell-cell communication. Also distributed non-locally as 'cosmic consciousness' linked by entanglement.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness acts as the algorithm for translating cellular memories into thought. It relies on control mechanisms rooted in the First Principles of Physiology (negative entropy, chemiosmosis, homeostasis).",
    "integration_or_binding": "Achieved through the compartmentation and integration of cell physiologic data (second tier), enhanced by quantum entanglement linking local and non-local states.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is codified in cellular memory via quantum entanglement to Newtonian Mechanics, representing the cell's history. Consciousness involves the flow and integration of this cellular data/memory.",

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Speculative/Conceptual. While based on scientific principles (physiology, quantum mechanics), the non-local components make traditional empirical testing difficult.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "N/A. The provided sources discuss the conceptual framework of the theory and note that related transcendent experiences (NDEs, OBEs) support non-materialist theories, but do not list specific tests designed to verify this theory.",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The source does not explicitly list criticisms. Justification: Likely faces critiques common to other quantum consciousness theories, especially regarding how quantum entanglement (a highly sensitive state) remains coherent and functional within the 'hot, wet' biological brain environment.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise mechanism by which the CNS acts as the 'algorithm' to translate cellular memory into thought requires definition. The physical nature and accessibility of the 'cosmic consciousness' remain speculative.",
    "ontological_coherence": "High internal coherence, as it explicitly integrates evolution, cosmology, and fundamental physics (classical and quantum) into a unified physiological framework. Coherence with mainstream materialist science is low due to non-local/cosmic claims."

      "stance": "Conditional",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is rooted in the unique 'First Principles of Physiology' (negative entropy, chemiosmosis, homeostasis) and dependent on quantum entanglement integral to biological cells, artificial systems would need to replicate or simulate these precise biological and quantum processes to achieve consciousness. This possibility is conceptually uncertain."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "The theory posits that local physiologic memories are paired with non-local memories that 'dwell in cosmic consciousness'. Survival beyond the local biological substrate is suggested, particularly in a non-local or cosmic sense."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Cosmic/Transcendent",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is linked to the non-local consciousness of the cosmos. The evolutionary goal is transcendence, moving closer to the non-local state, implying an ultimate, inherent cosmic purpose.",

        "stance": "Conditional",
        "rationale": "Virtual immortality would require replicating the specific quantum-physiological mechanisms of the cell and ensuring the virtual environment maintained the connection to the non-local cosmic consciousness via quantum entanglement, which is currently unknown if technologically manipulable."
