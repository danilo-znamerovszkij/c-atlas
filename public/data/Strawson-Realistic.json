    "summary": "This theory asserts that consciousness, or phenomenal experience, is wholly physical and is the most certain fact of our existence. Therefore, 'real' physicalism or materialism must entail panpsychism, meaning phenomenal properties are intrinsic to all fundamental physical stuff (energy/matter) and not radically emergent. This view aims to ground subjective experience directly within an expanded, realistic physical ontology.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness, as experiential phenomena, is identified as wholly physical, implying that fundamental physical stuff (like energy) is intrinsically an experience-involving phenomenon.",
    "ontological_status": "Realistic Monism / Real Physicalism (Entails Panpsychism)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Token identity: the mental/experiential 'just is' physical, suggesting that neurons, for example, have experiential properties not captured by current physics and neurophysiology.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive (or compositionally derived from primitive properties).",
    "emergence_type": "The theory rejects 'radical' emergence, arguing that consciousness must be inherent in the fundamental physical nature of reality, otherwise its existence would be denied, which is deemed absurd. Conscious experience arises via composition of fundamental experiential properties.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (conscious experience, 'what-it-is-likeness') is affirmed as the most certain fact of existence and the obligatory starting point for any realistic physicalism. Intentionality is included within this expanded physical reality.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (the qualitative feel) are affirmed as concretely real and wholly material, understood as intrinsic, non-reducible properties of fundamental physical entities (panpsychism).",
    "ontological_commitments": "A single fundamental concrete object or thing (monism), which is defined as physical but encompasses experiential/phenomenal properties. This includes all physical stuff, such as energy, being experience-involving.",
    "epistemic_access": "Primarily through introspection and first-person experience, as this experience is considered the fundamental given natural fact whose reality is more certain than anything else.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic building blocks are fundamental physical entities (energy/matter) that possess phenomenal or proto-phenomenal properties. The overall structure is that of a single, unified reality.",
    "basis_of_belief_or_evidence_type": "Philosophical and metaphysical argument, based on a realistic appraisal of the concrete reality of consciousness and the conceptual limits of current reductive physicalism."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal consciousness, including feeling, sensation, and explicit conscious thought.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle that logical coherence requires accepting the experiential nature of fundamental physical constituents, thereby solving the explanatory gap by changing the definition of the physical.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a fundamental feature, not strictly emergent from non-conscious components. Higher-level consciousness arises through the aggregation or combination of these fundamental experiential properties.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Distributed everywhere there is physical matter or energy, including within neurons in biological organisms.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Since the mental is wholly physical by definition, it must participate fully in the causal structure of the physical world, thereby resolving the mental causation problem inherent in dualism.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Unity of experience must be achieved by solving the 'combination problem' inherent in panpsychism, explaining how micro-level experiences combine into macro-level subjects of experience.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information processing is secondary to, or constituted by, the fundamental experiential properties of matter. (Information is implicit rather than explicitly defined as the core mechanism.)",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness is fundamental, thus evolution is a process of complex physical structures arising that can aggregate or express this inherent experiential property in complex ways.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Full recognition of the reality of experience is the obligatory starting point for a realistic physicalism.",

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Conceptually derived; the theory demands a reformation of fundamental physics to include experiential properties, making standard empirical testing difficult under current scientific paradigms.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Strongly criticized by traditional physicalists for conceptually redefining 'physical' to include experiential properties. The theory still faces the 'combination problem' of panpsychism (how micro-level experiences merge into complex, unified subjective experience).",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The most significant unresolved issue is finding a reasonable solution to the combination problem.",
    "ontological_coherence": "High, provided one accepts the broadened definition of physicalism. It is proposed as the most parsimonious solution for any physicalist who is realistic about experience.",

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is an intrinsic property of fundamental physical entities (panpsychism), then advanced technology should be able to manipulate these micropsychic aspects in artificial systems to generate complex inner awareness, as everything is made of the same experiential stuff."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Unlikely (Long Shot)",
      "rationale": "Although a monism, the framework is explicitly 'real materialist' and fundamentally physicalist, making survival beyond the dissolution of the physical body unlikely, similar to pure materialist theories."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Possibly",
      "rationale": "As a form of monism incorporating fundamental, intrinsic experience, it avoids the nihilistic conclusion often associated with deflationary materialism, leaving room for ultimate meaning or purpose to be tied to the nature of reality itself."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Probably",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is a regular and intrinsic property of physical organization, advanced hyper-technology capable of perfectly duplicating the physical state in a non-biological substrate should also duplicate the corresponding conscious state."
