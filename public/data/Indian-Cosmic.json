    "summary": "This theory posits that consciousness is the singular, nondual fundamental reality (Brahman) that constitutes all existence. Individual human consciousness is ultimately non-different from this pervasive Cosmic Consciousness, which generates first-person inner experiences (qualia). The physical world, including the body-mind complex, is considered derivative or illusionary.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness (Brahman/Cit) is the one nondual reality. Individual consciousness is identified as the all-pervading Cosmic Consciousness expressing itself through the body-mind complex.",
    "ontological_status": "Idealism (Ontological Idealism/Nondualism).",
    "mind_body_relationship": "The mind and physical world are derivative or illusionary manifestations of the fundamental consciousness. The consciousness shines through the body-mind complex, but is not the body or mind itself.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive (Fundamental). Consciousness is defined as the singular fundamental existent.",
    "emergence_type": "",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity and first-person inner experiences (qualia) are generated by the all-pervading cosmic consciousness. The individual 'self' or 'person' is considered conventionally real or illusory, while the essential nature is the non-different Self/Brahman.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (first-person inner experiences) are generated by the all-pervading cosmic consciousness. Experience is categorized into intransitive awareness (pure consciousness, devoid of content) and transitive awareness (phenomenal consciousness, which is a reflection or semblance of real consciousness).",
    "ontological_commitments": "A singular fundamental existent (Brahman/Consciousness). All physical worlds, matter, and energy are secondary or illusory manifestations.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible through philosophical investigation into the mind’s essential nature and derived from sacred texts (Upanishads). Proponents advocate considering meditative techniques and spiritual experience as having epistemic relevance.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic structure is the one nondual reality, which is Consciousness. Individual experiences arise from the divine consciousness playfully limiting itself to create unique conscious perspectives."
  },
  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal consciousness, self/soul, ultimate reality, transcendence, and spiritual realization.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Non-duality, where the infinite, ultimate consciousness limits or expresses itself in manifold, seemingly diverse forms to create individual subjects of experience.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is eternal and static in its fundamental nature. The physical universe and mental phenomena are generated or unfolded from this ultimate Consciousness (e.g., consciousness governs causation and creates energy/matter ).",
    "location_and_distribution": "Omnipresent and pervasive throughout reality. Consciousness is universalized as Soul.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is the ultimate source and ground of all being. It governs causation and creates energy and matter. The existence of consciousness is its own explanation, needing no outside cause.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is solved by non-duality: all individual conscious instances are fundamentally expressions of the singular Cosmic Consciousness, inherently unified.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information flow is not a primary mechanism in the ultimate reality model. Phenomenal experience (transitive awareness) acts as a semblance (cidābhāsa) of real consciousness, suggesting a form of functional representation, but the core reality remains awareness itself.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Conditional. The ultimate consciousness is fundamental and uncreated. However, some related Indian philosophical traditions, such as Sri Aurobindo’s view, incorporate an ongoing, progressing evolution of consciousness through higher gradations of being.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Brahman is all, and the Self is Brahman: Consciousness is the one nondual reality.",
      "The hard problem is dissolved because consciousness, being the origin, explains everything by itself.",
      "Individual conscious identity arises from the one divine consciousness playfully limiting itself."

  },
  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Speculative/Conceptual/Spiritual. The theory focuses on ultimate ontological reality, which is not typically subject to the scientific method.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Criticized for being anti-physicalist and relying on religious tradition. It faces the challenge of explaining how the physical world emerges or is derived from fundamental consciousness, an odd idea alien to common life experiences. It is contrasted with other Indian schools like GV Vedanta, which has differences regarding the ontological reality of matter and individual selves.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise mechanism by which the fundamental consciousness generates or interacts with matter and energy remains a major challenge. Also, the issue of whether individual identity persists (eating sugar) or dissolves (being sugar) upon liberation is debated.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent internally due to its monistic premise that all reality is one consciousness. Radically incompatible with materialistic and physicalist ontologies."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Likely (Conditional)",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is fundamental and pervasive throughout reality, then artificial systems could potentially instantiate or participate in cosmic consciousness, provided they meet the structural/complexity requirements for manifestation, though some idealists reject conscious AI based on current computer models."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes (Redefined)",
      "rationale": "Survival is a fundamental doctrine in Indian traditions (e.g., reincarnation). However, survival often means the eventual loss of current first-person awareness as consciousness is re-absorbed into the ultimate Cosmic Consciousness."
    },
    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Cosmic/Ultimate",
      "rationale": "By positing consciousness as the ground of all being and ultimate reality, the theory inherently provides cosmic meaning and purpose. Evolutionary Idealist views also see the evolution of consciousness as a primary feature of world meaning."
    },
    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Not needed",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is already fundamental and eternal (Idealism), traditional concepts of survival or eternal life are already theoretically available, making technological virtual immortality moot."
