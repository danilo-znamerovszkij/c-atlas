    "summary": "Searle argues that language is crucial for human consciousness, serving to shape and enrich conscious experience . This relationship is seen as an evolutionary \"boot-strapping effect\" where pre-linguistic consciousness enabled language, which in turn elaborated the structure of consciousness .",

    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Consciousness is ontologically subjective, existing only as experienced by a subject . Language enables complex, symbolic intentional states (e.g., performing income tax or writing poetry) unavailable to non-linguistic animals, despite animals possessing basic intentional states .",
