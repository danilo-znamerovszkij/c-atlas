    "theory_title": "Polkinghorne’s Dual-Aspect Monism",
    "summary": "This theory posits that matter and mind are complementary aspects of a single unitary being (psychosomatic nature), rejecting classical dualism and materialism. The mind, or soul, is conceived as an information-bearing pattern organized by the physical brain. This view is often framed within a Christian theological context to accommodate the continuity of personal identity necessary for the resurrection of the dead.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "The mind/soul is identified as the information-bearing pattern (or organizational structure) of the body/brain, while matter and mind are fundamentally complementary aspects of a unitary underlying reality.",
    "ontological_status": "Dual-Aspect Monism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind and matter are complementary aspects of a unitary being (psychosomatic unity), avoiding the sharp division of dualism. The physical systems afford non-reductive mental properties, with the mind acting as an information pattern carried by the brain.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent. Consciousness is not fundamental but emerges as a complex pattern of organization within a unitary reality.",
    "emergence_type": "Strong Emergence. Polkinghorne utilizes complexity theory and the unpredictability of dissipative systems to afford top-down causation and freedom, suggesting that the mind's patterns are functionally non-reducible, even if the underlying existence is monistic.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "The theory is built on acknowledging the subjective distinction between material and mental experience. The 'soul' as the information-bearing pattern is the carrier of the continuity and personal identity that defines the unique self.",
    "qualia_account": "The theory acknowledges the fundamental distinction of mental experiences. Qualia are implicitly rooted in the non-epiphenomenal mental aspect, which is the information-bearing pattern unique to the conscious subject.",
    "ontological_commitments": "A single underlying unitary reality or 'stuff'. The existence of information-bearing patterns (the soul) as a unique, non-material aspect of this reality.",
    "epistemic_access": "Knowledge is gained by examining both the complex nature of physical organization and by reflecting on the inherent distinction between mental and material experiences.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "A unitary reality expressing itself in material (brain/body) and mental (information-bearing pattern) aspects. The complexity and organization of the material constituents are key to the pattern formation."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal (as distinct experience), Self-awareness (as pattern continuity), Agency and Causal Role (via top-down control).",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The mind’s essence is the 'information-bearing pattern' of the physical system. This pattern exerts genuine causal force through top-down causality facilitated by intrinsic unpredictabilities in complex physical systems (dissipative systems in complexity theory).",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "The mental aspect arises from the extraordinary, complex organization of atoms in the brain. It is dynamic, tied to the flow of information, and not an epiphenomenon.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Located as the organizational pattern residing within the body/brain.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness has a genuine causal role through top-down causality in the complex physical system, influencing lower levels without violating physical laws (Nobel's principle of biological relativity, per associated ideas). Its function is to constitute the unified, thinking person.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is inherent in the psychosomatic unity. The 'soul' defined as the information pattern ensures the continuity and coherence of the individual being.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is central, as the soul is explicitly identified as the 'information-bearing pattern'. This pattern carries the unique essence of the individual.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness emerged from the increasing complexity of matter over time, consistent with universal evolution toward complexification.",

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Speculative/Conceptual. The core claim of the soul as an information pattern retained by God for reconstitution upon resurrection is theological and metaphysical, placing it outside the constraints of current empirical testability.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Polkinghorne rejects the charge that dual-aspect monism is a subtle materialism (epiphenomenalism). Critics argue that a simple pattern of information is insufficient to guarantee unique personal identity for reconstitution or resurrection (the problem of duplicates).",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The mechanism by which the information pattern (soul) is retained in 'divine memory' and reconstituted after the dissolution of the body remains a theological assertion. It lacks a detailed explanation for how non-material information exerts top-down causal power without violating physical laws.",
    "ontological_coherence": "High. The theory provides a coherent framework for reconciling monistic ontology (one underlying reality) with emergent mental distinction (dual-aspect) and theological necessity (resurrection, which requires personal continuity)."

    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is primarily an emergent pattern of information organized by a complex system, artificial systems of sufficient complexity and organization should theoretically be able to host this pattern and become conscious."

      "stance": "Yes (Conditional/Theological)",
      "rationale": "The essence of the person (the unique information-bearing pattern/soul) is maintained by 'divine memory' after death and will be reconstituted in a new form of matter at the resurrection, ensuring continuity."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Cosmic and Theological",
      "rationale": "The theory is motivated by finding a coherent account of human existence within a reality that allows for resurrection, implying ultimate purpose and value tied to divine intention and destiny."
    },
    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Yes (Conditional)",
      "rationale": "Virtual immortality is theoretically possible because the essential self is defined as an information-bearing pattern. Uploading this pattern to non-biological media would preserve the necessary identity component, provided the replication is perfect and the pattern is the sole element needed for 'me' to persist."
