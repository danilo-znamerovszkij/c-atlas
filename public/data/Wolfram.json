    "summary": "This theory seeks to formalize consciousness by embedding it within the 'Ruliad,' defined as the entangled limit of everything computationally possible, which encapsulates our physical universe. Consciousness is understood not as general computation, but as a specific feature of the brain that creates a coherent thread of experience by using bounded, simplified descriptions of this ultimate computational structure.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as a coherent thread of experience achieved through sequentialization and the utilization of bounded amounts of computation to simplify descriptions of the vast, computationally complex Ruliad.",

    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness is rooted in the computational/mathematical structure of reality (the Ruliad) and is realized as a particular organizational feature of physical brains (specifically, 'branching brains').",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Emergent (Implicitly Weak/Computational). Consciousness is a 'step down' associated with computational reducibility, allowing simplified descriptions of the universe, rather than a fundamental property.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is implicit in having a 'coherent thread of experience.' The privacy of consciousness is explained by different consciousnesses occupying distinct locations in 'rulial space' due to differing histories, making it difficult for one to 'get inside' another.",
    "qualia_account": "Implicitly accounted for by the resulting 'coherent thread of experience' and the formation of 'definite thoughts' based on bounded computation and sequentialization. This coherence provides the necessary structure for subjective perception.",

    "location_and_distribution": "Localized in the brain ('particular feature of our brains'), but fundamentally defined and constrained by the universal computational structure of the Ruliad.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "It serves to integrate what is happening into a coherent whole, allowing definite thoughts to form. Functionally, consciousness is crucial for computational reducibility, which drives our understanding of scientific laws.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved by forming a 'coherent thread of experience' and having ways to 'integrate what’s happening' to form 'definite thoughts.' Sequentialization is central to this process.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Involves sampling the Ruliad corresponding to our particular way of perceiving and interpreting the universe. The essence involves computational sophistication but is defined by complexity reduction.",

      "stance": "Probably",
      "rationale": "Since consciousness is characterized as a specific type of computational coherence (a 'software' outcome of bounded computation), it is likely that this structure could, in principle, be duplicated in a non-biological substrate, enabling virtual immortality."
