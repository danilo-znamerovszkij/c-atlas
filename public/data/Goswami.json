    "theory_title": "Goswami’s Self-Aware Universe",
    "summary": "This theory of Idealism proposes that consciousness, not matter, is the fundamental reality and the primary stuff of creation. It uses the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, asserting that consciousness acts as the necessary agency to collapse the quantum wave function, thus bringing physical reality into manifestation.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is the singular fundamental 'stuff' of creation, acting as the agency that 'chooses' the results of quantum measurement to construct physical reality.",
    "ontological_status": "Ontological Idealism. Consciousness is the ultimate, fundamental existent.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness creates the material world, reversing the traditional materialist dependency. The brain functions as an active quantum system that selects which unconscious processes become conscious.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive",
    "emergence_type": "",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity stems from the 'one consciousness in the universe' in which all individuals participate. Individual egos are manifestations of 'constricted consciousness.' Intentionality is expressed by consciousness actively 'choosing' measurement results.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are implicitly fundamental, as they are aspects of the singular, fundamental consciousness. The theory focuses on the identity of consciousness as reality itself rather than mechanistically explaining individual qualitative feels.",
    "ontological_commitments": "A singular, universal consciousness; quantum objects existing in potentia; and manifest mental and material objects.",
    "epistemic_access": "Through philosophical interpretation of quantum mechanics and direct experience, specifically by achieving 'expanded states of consciousness' beyond the constricted ego.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "A singular, interconnected universal consciousness. Individual minds are localized or constrained expressions of this whole."

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is dynamic, playing an active role in constructing reality by selecting outcomes in the quantum world. Individual consciousness (the ego) is a constrained, localized form of the universal process.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Universal (Cosmic). Consciousness is the 'stuff' of creation, meaning it is omnipresent and interconnected throughout all existence.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is the ultimate cause, actively constructing physical reality. The brain functions as an active quantum system to select and determine which unconscious mental processes become conscious.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is intrinsic to reality, as there is only one consciousness and all creation is interconnected. The phenomenal unity of experience stems from this singular subject.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Mental activities are treated as 'mental objects' subject to quantum mechanics. Information flow relates to the quantum probability states being collapsed by the choice of consciousness.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The source material does not provide an explicit phylogenetic account, but the Idealist premise implies that consciousness is antecedent to or co-extensive with biological evolution.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Criticized for being a non-materialist theory dependent on a specific interpretation of quantum mechanics (Copenhagen). It must address the 'decomposition problem'—how distinct, localized subjects arise from a unitary universal consciousness.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise mechanism by which the singular Universal Consciousness localizes into individual consciousness (the ego) and how the brain functions as an active quantum system remain open conceptual issues.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Internally coherent within the Idealist framework, particularly when combined with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, but radically incompatible with materialist ontologies."

      "stance": "Yes",

      "rationale": "If the consciousness can localize its experiences through a physical structure (the brain), a perfect reconstruction of that structure in a non-biological medium might allow the universal consciousness to 'constrict' itself identically, enabling subjective continuation."
