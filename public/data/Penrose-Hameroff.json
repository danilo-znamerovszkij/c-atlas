    "theory_title": "Penrose-Hameroff’s Orchestrated Objective Reduction",
    "summary": "This theory posits that consciousness arises from non-computational, gravitation-mediated objective reduction (OR) of quantum superpositions occurring within the protein structures (microtubules) inside brain neurons. This process, termed Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR), bridges the gap between quantum mechanics and classical reality to produce phenomenal experience.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as a non-computational physical process—the specific orchestration of gravitation-mediated objective reduction of quantum states linked to the fine-scale structure of spacetime geometry. Proto-conscious moments are fundamental and ubiquitous in the universe.",
    "ontological_status": "Quantum Theory (Non-computational Physicalism / Proto-panpsychism)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness is non-computational physics. The brain's microtubules act as a mechanism to orchestrate proto-conscious quantum activity into coherent, rich conscious experiences, requiring a physics beyond current understanding.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent/Primitive (Hybrid)",
    "emergence_type": "Strong Emergence",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Orch OR ambitiously accounts for the hard problem of phenomenal experience. Subjectivity is linked to the non-computable nature of choice or reduction during the quantum collapse event.",
    "qualia_account": "Rich conscious experience (qualia) arises when orchestrated objective reduction occurs in neuronal microtubules, connecting the quantum information processing to the fundamental structure of spacetime geometry.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Proto-conscious moments, quantum superposition, gravitational self-collapse, and neuronal microtubules.",

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic flow arising when quantum systems collapse due to gravitational self-energy, operating in the fundamental temporal gap between the continuous quantum evolution and discrete classical events.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized within neuronal microtubules, particularly in the brain, but fundamentally drawing upon ubiquitous proto-conscious properties throughout the universe.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness provides real-time conscious causal action through non-computable objective reduction events, potentially linked to the fundamental mechanisms of free will and choice.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The theory accounts for cognitive binding by postulating that Orch OR events unify diverse inputs into a single, momentary conscious percept.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is processed via coherent quantum superposition in microtubules, influencing higher-level chemical and electrical activity necessary for neuronal signaling.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness may have preceded life, with proto-conscious moments being fundamental to the universe. Life evolved by utilizing and orchestrating these ubiquitous proto-conscious processes.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The main tension is the challenge of maintaining quantum coherence for biological timescales in the hot, wet environment of the brain (environmental decoherence). The theory also requires non-existent physics (quantum gravity).",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise mechanism for how quantum information influences macroscopic neuronal signaling remains unclear. Requires the unification of quantum mechanics and gravity, the holy grail of physics.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent within the framework of an expanded physics that includes proto-conscious properties at the fundamental level, but incompatible with classical or contemporary physicalism and functionalism."
