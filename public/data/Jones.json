    "summary": "This theory classifies and supports the idea that the mind is identical to the neural electromagnetic (EM) field generated by the brain's aggregate electrical activity. This unified field is believed to interact with neuronal circuits, providing a basis for the unity of consciousness and addressing the origin of qualia.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness (the mind) is identified as the unified neural electromagnetic (EM) field generated by the collective electrical activity of the brain, or, in a specific variant, consciousness is the fundamental nature of matter-energy that unites neuro-electrically.",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism/Materialism (Primary Classification); overlaps with a monistic/panpsychist view in the Neuroelectrical Panpsychism variant supported by Jones.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Identity Theory: the simplest explanation is that minds are identical to the neural EM fields. The fields also interact causally with neuronal cells and circuits.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent (from aggregated neural activity) or Primitive (in the Neuroelectrical Panpsychism variant where consciousness is the real nature of matter-energy). Classified primarily as Emergent due to its placement under Materialism/Neurobiological frameworks.",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence (the electromagnetic field is a direct physical consequence of underlying neural processes).",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity arises from the unified structure created by the electrical combination of micro-experiences in the brain (as argued by Jones's Neuroelectrical Panpsychism variant).",
    "qualia_account": "The theory places qualia on the explanatory agenda. The Neuroelectrical Panpsychism variant suggests neuroelectrical activities generate and unite different qualia, addressing the hard problem by positing consciousness as the real nature of matter-energy.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Neural currents, brain-spanning electromagnetic fields (EM), and neural circuits.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible through empirical measurement and observation of electrical activity in the brain, such as synchronous neuronal discharges.",

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The mind is constituted by the broader, brain-spanning EM fields generated by specific neural currents, which act as a unified substrate for consciousness.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness arises dynamically from mechanisms like the synchronization of oscillating neuronal discharges, particularly in the gamma range (30–80 Hz), proposed to act as an integrative mechanism.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The consciousness substrate is the intricate three-dimensional web of brain-spanning electromagnetic fields within the brain.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The unified neural EM fields interact with neuronal cells and circuits to explain correlations, and help guide brain operations.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The unification of experience (the unity of minds) is achieved naturally by the integrated physical structure of the unified neural electromagnetic field itself.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "The EM field is hypothesized to encode information, though detailed flow mechanisms are not explicitly laid out, beyond the fact that fields interact causally with circuits.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The source material does not explicitly detail an evolutionary account for this specific theory's emergence. (Justification: Source material limitations.)",

      "Measuring synchronization of oscillating neuronal discharges (e.g., 30–80 Hz gamma oscillations) as correlates of cognitive acts and integration."
    ],
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Electromagnetic field theories generally remain controversial and are often ignored by neurobiologists and philosophers. The specific proposal of Neuroelectrical Panpsychism is a radical identity claim.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "A primary unresolved issue is defining precisely what causal functions the EM fields serve (if any) and how these fields relate directly to phenomenal experience (qualia) beyond correlation.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent within an extended Materialist ontology that accepts physical fields as the substrate of consciousness. The inclusion of the Neuroelectrical Panpsychism variant complicates ontological coherence by positing consciousness as the fundamental nature of matter-energy."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "As a Materialist/Electromagnetic Field theory, consciousness depends on specific physical field structures. If technology can replicate the hardware capable of generating and manipulating the necessary EM field patterns, AI consciousness should be achievable in principle."

      "stance": "Humanistic only",
      "rationale": "The theory is rooted in physical mechanisms and principles (materialism), suggesting consciousness arises naturally without external cosmic teleology or ultimate meaning."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "Virtual immortality depends on duplicating the consciousness substrate. If the conscious mind is reducible to a precise, complex EM field pattern, this pattern should be replicable in a non-biological medium, enabling digital continuation, albeit highly complex to achieve practically."
