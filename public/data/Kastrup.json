    "summary": "Analytic Idealism is a consciousness-only ontology asserting that phenomenal consciousness is fundamental, the singular primitive of reality. Everything else in nature, including the physical world and individual minds, is grounded in patterns of excitation or expressions of this spatially unbound cosmic consciousness.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as the singular, spatially unbound, fundamental ontological primitive (cosmic consciousness).",
    "ontological_status": "Idealism (Modern analytic metaphysics)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Individual minds are dissociated alters of the cosmic consciousness. The inanimate physical world is the extrinsic view of thoughts and emotions within this universal consciousness, meaning a physical world independent of consciousness is a mistaken intellectual abstraction.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive (Fundamental)",
    "emergence_type": "N/A",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Individual subjectivity arises from the localization created by the dissociation of the cosmic consciousness. Intentionality is grounded in the inherent properties of the fundamental awareness.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are intrinsically real and fundamental, constituting patterns of excitation within the fundamental phenomenal consciousness.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Phenomenal consciousness (Cosmic Consciousness); Dissociated alters; Patterns of excitation.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible fundamentally through phenomenal experience/introspection, as consciousness is the basis of all reality. Circumstantial empirical evidence (e.g., altered states) is used to challenge physicalist alternatives.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic building block is spatially unbound consciousness. Individual entities are localized structures created via dissociation within this unitary field."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal consciousness, ontology of reality, physical existence, life after death.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle of dissociation, which localizes the unitary cosmic consciousness into seemingly isolated subjects (alters).",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is fundamental and dynamic (a creative process). Individual minds arise through the dissociation process, localized within the greater cosmic consciousness.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Ubiquitous; consciousness is fundamental and spatially unbound. Individual conscious subjects are localized boundary conditions (dissociated alters).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Causation is grounded in consciousness itself. The inanimate world is the extrinsic manifestation of universal mentation, while the brain serves to constrain or mediate individual consciousness.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is inherent in the unitary nature of the cosmic consciousness. Localization or unification within an individual mind is defined by the boundaries of the dissociated alter.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Physical processes (like brain activity) correlate tightly with personal mentation because they correspond to the extrinsic view of that mentation, which is rooted in consciousness.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Not addressed directly as a mechanism for the origin of consciousness, since consciousness is fundamental, but assumes that individual organisms evolve as part of the structure of cosmic consciousness.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Phenomenal consciousness is the sole ontological primitive.",

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Speculative/Conceptual. Testable primarily by demonstrating the incoherence or lack of parsimony of rival metaphysical theories and by predicting experiential outcomes in extreme states.",

      "Cites neuroimaging of psychedelic states (rich experience correlating with reduced brain activity) to critique physicalist theories."
    ],
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The main critical challenge is the 'decomposition problem': explaining how seemingly distinct phenomenal inner lives of subjects can arise within a fundamentally unitary phenomenal field. Also must reconcile the independence of the common external world from personal volition.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The core difficulty is fully detailing the mechanism of dissociation and how localization (the decomposition problem) is maintained and experienced by individual alters.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within its own idealist framework and argues for greater explanatory parsimony than physicalism, panpsychism, and cosmopsychism."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Kastrup suggests conscious AI is a fantasy, arguing that consciousness is not reducible to computation or information processing that current computers perform. Consciousness is tied to fundamental phenomenal reality, not hardware function."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "Bodily death is predicted to result in the cessation of the local boundary (dissociated alter), causing conscious inner life to expand back into the underlying universal consciousness. This is supported circumstantially by reports of near-death experiences (NDEs)."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Cosmic and Ultimate",

      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is not an algorithm or software program reducible to physical structure; therefore, uploading neural patterns (simulated continuation) would only result in a functional duplication ('deep fake') lacking true subjective experience."
