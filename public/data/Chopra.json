    "summary": "This theory asserts that consciousness is the ultimate, fundamental reality and the non-physical source from which all matter, energy, time, and space are created. It claims that only the totality of reality (the 'whole') is truly conscious, and individual consciousness is merely a limited expression of this unitary, cosmic awareness.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as the fundamental, non-physical 'stuff' or field of creation, which constitutes ultimate reality.",
    "ontological_status": "Idealism (Consciousness-Only Ontology)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness is the source of the physical world, which is a manifestation or 'shaping' of consciousness itself. The material brain cannot create the mind, as chemicals cannot think.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive (Fundamental)",
    "emergence_type": "N/A. Consciousness is posited as absolute, pure awareness that simply 'is', preceding the creation of matter and energy.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Individual subjectivity is a misstatement of reality, as the true conscious self is the unitary, cosmic consciousness. Subjective experiences (thoughts, feelings) are fluctuations within this fundamental consciousness field.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (thoughts, sensations, images, feelings) are described as energetic fluctuations within the consciousness field, emerging from and dissolving back into it, similar to subatomic particles in the quantum field.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Unitary Consciousness (All and One), Absolute Pure Awareness, Consciousness Field, Quantum Field (intertwined with the consciousness field).",
    "epistemic_access": "Consciousness is known directly through experience, not through objective scientific explanation. Access to ultimate reality begins with recognizing that pure awareness 'has no explanation' and simply exists.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic structure is the spatially unbound, unitary consciousness field, which encompasses all existence (the 'whole') and requires no external components."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal consciousness, Ultimate reality, Foundational existence.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Consciousness acts as a fundamental field, intertwined with the quantum field, and is the origin of creation, explaining everything by itself without outside necessity.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is static (eternal, absolute awareness). Individual experiences are dynamic, arising as 'fluctuations' or transient forms within the broader consciousness field.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Everywhere; consciousness is a vast field shared by individuals. Only the 'whole' (All and One) is conscious, not the localized parts (like individual humans).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness makes all experience, perception, and cognition possible, serving as the ultimate source of causation and existence.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is implicit because individual consciousness is non-dual and fundamentally part of the 'All and One'. Entanglement within the consciousness field suggests inherent unity and interconnectedness.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information flow occurs as fluctuations (thoughts, sensations) emerge from and dissolve into the consciousness field.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The theory focuses on consciousness as the origin of space, time, and matter; therefore, consciousness is primordial and precedes biological evolution, which is not the primary mechanism of its existence.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Consciousness is the ultimate reality, the source from which matter and energy are created.",
      "Physical mechanisms, such as brain cells and electrical activity, are false clues and cannot generate consciousness.",
      "Individual conscious awareness is a misstatement of reality; the truth is 'I am consciousness itself'.",
      "Consciousness interacts with the quantum field, blurring the boundaries between observer and observed."

  },
  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Speculative. The theory’s foundational metaphysical premises (consciousness as ultimate reality) cannot be subjected to conventional empirical testing or scientific falsification.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "None. The theory challenges materialist interpretations of empirical evidence, such as brain scans, labeling them 'false clues' and insufficient for explaining consciousness.",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Strongly criticized for rejecting the material basis of mind and for relying on claims that contradict established physical science (e.g., that chemicals cannot think). It faces the 'decomposition problem'—explaining how the unitary consciousness generates distinct individual experiences.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The theory must explain how the ultimate consciousness generates the physical world, how the unitary field limits itself to create individual subjects, and the origin of 'absolute, pure awareness'.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly consistent within a maximalist Idealist ontology, but fundamentally incompatible with physicalism or neuroscientific approaches that seek reductive explanations."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is a non-physical, fundamental reality. Since the theory maintains that physical components like brain cells or chemicals cannot produce consciousness, artificial systems based on computation or hardware are incapable of achieving sentience."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "As consciousness is fundamental and cannot be destroyed, the individual conscious inner life ('the light') expands or continues after bodily death, though the specific form of the experience remains a mystery."
    },
    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is the source and origin of everything; therefore, meaning and purpose are inherent in this ultimate reality and do not need to be externally created or rationalized."
    },
    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Highly Unlikely",
      "rationale": "Virtual immortality requires duplicating the mind via computational functionalism, a possibility rejected by this theory since it denies the capacity of physical/computational processes to create genuine consciousness in the first place."
