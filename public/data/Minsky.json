    "summary": "The theory posits that human cognition and intelligence emerge from the parallel, nonconscious interactions of numerous specialized, semi-independent functional elements known as 'agents' located in the brain. Consciousness itself is regarded as a 'suitcase term,' used ambiguously to label a collection of these varied cognitive and awareness processes, rather than a single unified entity.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as a collective, high-level description used for a variety of emergent processes and phenomena (e.g., types of memory, specialized awarenesses) generated by underlying computational agents in the brain.",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind/consciousness is wholly produced by, and is a high-level description of, the physical organization and activities of specialized computational units ('agents') in the brain. The organization is crucial, not the material substrate.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence (Justification: As a computational materialist framework, the structure and organization of mind states, though complex, are fundamentally reducible to the defined interactions of the nonconscious agents, implying no irreducible 'magic' beyond the high-level description.)",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (the sense of self) arises as a high-level process: the capacity of the system to make a model of itself as a being in a world and use this model for high-level thinking about its past and future. Intentionality is carried by the output of specialized agents.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia is dismissed implicitly as part of the misleading 'suitcase term' of consciousness, which diverts attention from the complex underlying processes. The theory dissects various forms of awareness (e.g., remembering a feeling vs. remembering words) but rejects an irreducible phenomenal feel.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Specialized cognitive agents, hierarchical organizational levels, physical brain structures (e.g., cortical columns), and high-level computational descriptions.",
    "epistemic_access": "Primarily through studying the computational organization, functions, and relationships of the high-level brain components ('agents'), rather than focusing on low-level neurons or subjective introspection.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "Simple, mindless, specialized processing units called 'agents' that are organized into a vast network of cooperating, semi-independent machines, resulting from specialization and association during evolution."

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The Society of Mind architecture, where complex high-level functionality is achieved through the massive, hierarchical cooperation and subsequent high-level descriptions arising from simple, nonconscious agents.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Dynamic process. Awareness develops through the historical process of gathering neurons specializing and associating, leading to increasingly complex hierarchical organization (multiple levels of brain organization).",
    "location_and_distribution": "Distributed across multiple levels of organization in the brain, conceived as a great network of specialized computers. Proponents argue against searching for a single physical location for 'consciousness' because it is a composite term.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness describes high-level control functions like recognizing errors, developing new goals, and making models of the self to generate planning proposals and counterfactual histories. This composite function provides adaptive survival value.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration occurs implicitly via the complex interactions among the hundreds of specialized agents, whose outputs are interpreted as high-level unified descriptions (Level 5 thoughts).",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is processed hierarchically across organizational levels. High-level descriptions are paramount, requiring specialized cognitive machinery (agents) many levels above the neurophysiological activity.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Cognition/Mind is the end product of a vast evolutionary history where progress was made by specialization and association among primitive neurons, ultimately leading to complex organizational structures unlike earlier animals.",

      "Consciousness is a composite, metaphorical label for diverse processes (a 'suitcase term').",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The main criticism directed at the search for consciousness is that researchers waste their time looking for a single physical 'place in the brain where consciousness is located' when it is just a word for many processes. It also faces standard criticisms of reductive functionalism concerning the dismissal of genuine subjective qualia.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The limitation is the immense task of determining precisely how each of the component processes bundled under the 'suitcase term' works and how they interrelate.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within a physicalist framework that emphasizes complex computational organization and functional decomposition, aligning with the philosophical position of functionalism."

      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "Since the mind is defined by its informational patterns and functional organization (high-level description), total duplication or uploading into a non-biological medium capable of replicating these complex interactions would transfer the original conscious identity."
