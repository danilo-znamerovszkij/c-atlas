    "summary": "This theory postulates that consciousness and free will are fundamental properties of quantum systems existing in pure quantum states, relying crucially on non-local quantum entanglement. It identifies consciousness as the subjective inner reality of these quantum systems, experienced as definite and private qualia.",

    "mind_body_relationship": "Dual-aspect (Justified Explanation: The mind aspect is the private, qualitative subjective reality described by quantum information, which is an intrinsic, inseparable property of certain physical systems—pure quantum states.)",

    "emergence_type": "Not applicable (Primitive)",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is inherent because a pure quantum state is conscious of its own state; this experience is intrinsically private. Intentionality, particularly creativity and imagination, emerges from this fundamental non-algorithmic quantum layer.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are the direct, non-numeric, subjective experience of a quantum system's state, characterized by the definite and integrated nature of pure quantum states.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Quantum systems in pure quantum states, quantum information, and quantum entanglement are fundamental ontological commitments, existing in a layer of reality ruled by quantum physics.",
    "epistemic_access": "Inferred conceptually by finding an isomorphism between the phenomenal properties of consciousness (privacy, definiteness) and the intrinsic characteristics of quantum states (non-cloneability, integration).",
    "constituents_and_structure": "Quantum information and entanglement are the basic building blocks, providing the definitive, integrated structure of consciousness.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Ubiquitous (Justified Explanation: As a form of panpsychism, consciousness or protoconsciousness is implicitly distributed across reality wherever quantum systems in pure states are found.)"

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Free Will, Creativity",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The key mechanism is the existence of quantum systems in a pure quantum state, enabling non-algorithmic properties like free will and creativity that cannot exist in a classical, deterministic universe.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Dynamic Process (Justified Explanation: Consciousness enables complex, creative actions like imagination and intuition, suggesting a dynamic, non-deterministic process arising from the underlying quantum mechanics.)",
    "location_and_distribution": "Quantum systems in pure quantum states/Fundamental quantum layer",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness, through quantum entanglement, possesses causal efficacy by building thoughts and generating non-algorithmic properties like true creativity and free will."

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Faces general skepticism directed toward quantum theories of consciousness by mainstream neuroscientists and physicists. Must solve the combination problem inherent in panpsychism—explaining how micro-experiences scale up to complex macro-consciousness.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise mechanism for how quantum states in the brain (or any complex system) relate to the emergence of specific macro-conscious experiences (the combination problem) is an acknowledged limitation.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly Coherent internally, highly speculative externally (Justified Explanation: The theory maintains internal consistency by matching phenomenal axioms with quantum axioms but requires a fundamental shift in the accepted materialist ontology of physics.)"
