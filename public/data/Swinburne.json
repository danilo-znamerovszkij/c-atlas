    "summary": "This theory posits that a person consists of two radically distinct components: a physical body/brain and a separate, nonphysical substance, or soul, which is independent of the physical world. The nonphysical soul is an essential and irreducible entity required to account for conscious life and to maintain personal identity through time.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified with the inner conscious life possessed by the separate, nonphysical substance (the soul), which is distinct from physical processes.",
    "ontological_status": "Substance Dualism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Interactionist Dualism. Although the specific mechanism is highly debated, the nonphysical substance must correlate with or interact with the physical brain to account for conscious life within a human person.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive. The soul is a separate, fundamental, nonphysical substance, not reducible to physical states or subject to purely physical explanation.",
    "emergence_type": "Not applicable; consciousness is identified with a primitive nonphysical substance (the soul). The soul's existence is determined either by a creative act (God) or irreducible laws, not purely by physical processes rising to complexity.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (first-person experience) is an irreducible property possessed by the nonphysical substance (the soul), making the soul the essential subject of experience and responsible for conscious life.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (the qualitative feel of experience) are properties of the separate mental entity (the soul) which constitute 'conscious life' and cannot be accounted for solely by the physical body or brain.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical substances (bodies, brains, atoms) and nonphysical substances (souls/mental entities).",
    "epistemic_access": "Primarily accessed via first-person experience (conscious life) and philosophical arguments, especially arguments concerning personal identity, which reveal truths about persons irreducible to brains/bodies.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The individual person is a composite of a physical body/brain and a separate, essential nonphysical soul. The soul itself is the indivisible subject of experience.",

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The existence of an irreducible, nonphysical substance (soul) that serves as the subject of experience and carries personal identity, independent of the physical brain .",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Static/Creationist. Consciousness exists as an irreducible substance, either created instantaneously by God or arising via laws of nature upon sufficient complexity, but its nature is static substance, not dynamic process emergence .",
    "location_and_distribution": "The nonphysical soul is localized to an individual and associated with a specific physical body .",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The functional role is to ground personal identity over time and to possess conscious life. If interactionist, the soul must have causal power to influence the physical world.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Unity is inherent to the singular, nonphysical substance (the soul) that serves as the irreducible subject of all experiences, accounting for the wholeness of conscious life .",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Not explicitly defined in terms of information flow; the nonphysical soul substance provides the ontological basis (who has which conscious life) rather than explaining how specific information is processed .",
    "evolutionary_account": "Focuses on the metaphysical requirement for an irreducible substance for personhood rather than an evolutionary explanation of consciousness arising from matter .",

      "Conscious life requires subjects of experience (souls) that are radically separate, nonphysical substances .",
      "Physical properties alone cannot distinguish between distinct conscious persons (the personal identity argument) .",

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Conceptually testable through philosophical and logical arguments regarding personal identity, but generally considered empirically speculative or untestable by physicalist paradigms due to its reliance on a nonphysical substance.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The main tension is the interaction problem: Dualism struggles to explain how a nonphysical substance can interact causally with a physical brain without violating physical laws, such as the conservation of energy . Swinburne's view is also criticized regarding how laws could govern the creation of a *specific* individual soul .",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise mechanism by which the nonphysical substance interacts with the physical brain (the interaction problem) remains unresolved .",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent within its dualistic ontology, specifically addressing issues of personal identity that materialist theories fail to capture . However, it faces deep conceptual conflicts with physicalist frameworks that assume the causal closure of physics."
