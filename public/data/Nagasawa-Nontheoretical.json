    "theory_title": "Nagasawaâ€™s Nontheoretical Physicalism Theory",
    "summary": "This theory claims that the world is entirely physical, yet it contains specific physical facts about consciousness that cannot be captured or explained even by complete theories of the physical sciences. It functions as an alternative formulation of physicalism that seeks to reconcile physical ontology with the apparent failures of reductive theories to grasp phenomenal consciousness.",

    "ontological_status": "Physicalism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind/consciousness is identical to physical reality; however, certain facts about consciousness are inaccessible to traditional theoretical knowledge (epistemic gap), necessitating an entity-based rather than theory-based understanding of this identity.",

    "emergence_type": "Strong Emergence",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjective experience is grounded in specific, 'nontheoretical' physical facts which cannot be captured by complete scientific explanation, thereby preserving the epistemic mystery of subjectivity while asserting its physical nature.",

    "ontological_commitments": "Physical reality, physical entities, and nontheoretical physical facts.",
    "epistemic_access": "Epistemologically limited via traditional scientific theory; conceptual access is derived through philosophical analysis of arguments against traditional physicalism (moving from epistemology to ontology).",

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Dynamic details are limited because the consciousness facts are defined as 'nontheoretical'; emergence is presumed based on the existence of appropriate complex physical entities.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The physical world; associated with specific physical entities (e.g., neural mechanisms) which contain the uncaptured facts.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Not explicitly detailed in sources; inferred to adhere to standard physical causation within the constraints of an entirely physical world.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Undefined, as the theory focuses primarily on the metaphysical definition and the epistemic gap rather than specific internal processing dynamics.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Faces the tension inherent in defining physicalism by appealing to aspects of reality that necessarily escape complete scientific theorization, risking ontological ambiguity. It is a defense against the failures of traditional physicalism.",

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "As a form of physicalism, consciousness is tied to the physical world, and there is no indication it allows for persistence after the dissolution of the physical substrate."
