    "theory_title": "LeDoux Deep Roots Theory of Consciousness",
    "summary": "This theory views human consciousness and behavior through the lens of deep evolutionary history, positing that consciousness emerged relatively recently as a sophisticated product of cortical cognitive circuits. It tracks how foundational survival abilities, inherited from the earliest organisms, were enhanced by the evolution of nervous systems, ultimately leading to consciousness.",

    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "The theory links consciousness to the evolutionary necessity of enhancing survival and thriving. Subjectivity (like the feeling of fear) emerges as a recent expression of cortical cognitive circuits, distinct from the ancient non-conscious survival circuits.",
    "qualia_account": "The text describing this theory focuses on evolutionary history and survival circuits rather than qualia itself, but consistent with its materialist stance, qualia are implicitly treated as complex expressions of cortical cognitive circuits, having a shallow evolutionary history compared to survival circuits.",

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic process characterized by a 'shallower history' of emergence, specifically as a recent expression of cortical cognitive circuits built upon ancient defensive survival circuits.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Lacking specific critiques in the provided text, general criticism applicable to Materialism theories is the failure to explain the qualitative essence of consciousness (Hard Problem) despite understanding its biological basis and evolution.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise steps leading to the emergence of subjective experience, distinguishing the cortical cognitive circuits responsible for conscious feelings (shallow history) from non-conscious survival mechanisms (deep history), remain open questions.",

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Humanistic only",
      "rationale": "Consistent with Materialism, consciousness primarily serves the biological function of enhancing survival and thriving, offering no inherent cosmic meaning or teleology beyond that which humans create for themselves."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "Since consciousness is understood as purely physical and emergent from complex biological information processing, duplication of the neural pattern should, in principle, allow for virtual immortality."
