    "summary": "This set of older theories attributes consciousness to the functioning of large-scale neurophysiological structures and dynamic electrical activity, such as lateral pathways, the reticular activating system, vertical thalamocortical radiations (circuits), and synchronous neuronal firing (cycles, like EEG waves) across broad brain regions. These explanations are generally considered insufficient by themselves and have evolved into more sophisticated, contemporary neurobiological theories.",

They address correlation and process, but often fail to fully explain the nature of phenomenal experience (the 'what it is').",
