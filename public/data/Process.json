    "theory_title": "Process Theory",
    "summary": "Process Theory is a metaphysical framework asserting that fundamental reality consists of dynamic change and becoming, not static substances. It embraces a panexperientialist ontology, positing that experience is inherent throughout nature and that consciousness emerges as a creative advance achieved through the evolution of experiential events over time.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as a fundamental, partially self-creative process or 'experiential creativity' inherent in the basic events (occasions) that constitute reality.",
    "ontological_status": "Panexperientialist Monism (Process-Relational). It holds that reality is composed of one fundamental kind of stuff (events/processes) that possesses both mental and physical aspects.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind and body are complementary aspects of a single reality, where mind is analogous to the novelty-inducing pole and matter to the stability-providing pole of the underlying process. They are intertwined, not separate substances.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Both Primitive and Emergent. Experience is fundamental (panexperientialism), but complex consciousness is genuinely emergent as an 'achievement' or 'creative advance' of evolutionary processes.",
    "emergence_type": "Emergent (Creative Advance). Consciousness arises through 'concrescence'â€”a cumulative, creative repetition of the past that produces 'novel togetherness,' rather than mere additive combination of parts.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity arises from the inherent, partially self-creative nature of experiential events. Intentionality is implicitly tied to the forward-looking nature of experience, manifesting as a tension between inherited past and anticipated future.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are understood as 'agitations of experience' or concrete subjective qualities that arise from the inherently mental aspect of fundamental energy/activity, not merely reducible to material structures.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Reality consists fundamentally of events or 'occasions' rather than fixed substances; these events are 'process-relational' and are organized by a cosmic actuality (often conceived as God or Universal Soul).",
    "epistemic_access": "Consciousness is accessed primarily through first-person lived experience and philosophical analysis of fundamental existence (metaphysics), which then informs the understanding of objective scientific data.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The structure is bipolar or dipolar, meaning each fundamental event has both a mental pole (novelty, subjective aim) and a material pole (stability, conformity to prior facts), operating in a hierarchical, relational manner."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal; Panexperiential (basic sentience ubiquitous in nature); Agency; Self-awareness (as an evolved outcome of complex process).",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Concrescence, defined as the ongoing process by which dispersed elements (past events) unify into a new, complex, unique, and conscious 'occasion of experience' (novel togetherness).",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a ceaselessly dynamic and temporal substance of reality. Higher consciousness dynamically emerges through the persistent, complex unfolding of events over time, demonstrating 'creative advance'.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Ubiquitous in all fundamental processes of reality (panexperientialism). Localized complex consciousness occurs in organized systems (like brains) as particularly successful achievements of concrescence.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Processes are inherently 'partially self-creative,' suggesting a strong form of metaphysical agency rooted in fundamental reality. The mental pole induces novelty, making it crucial for creativity and emergence.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is accomplished by concrescence, where disparate aspects of an event coalesce into a novel, unified whole, often viewed as 'existentially unified' or fused.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is inherent in the process-relational nature of events, flowing as tension between the actual facts of the past and the potential possibilities of the future.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness is an inherent part of the universal flux that evolves over time. Complex consciousness emerges as an 'achievement of the evolution of experience' (creative advance), selected by the cosmos' inherent drive toward novelty and self-realization.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Fundamental reality is dynamic process and becoming, not static substance.",
      "Experience (proto-consciousness) is basic to nature (panexperientialism).",
      "Consciousness emerges through continuous acts of 'concrescence' (novel composition).",
      "Avoids the interaction problem of dualism by defining mind and matter as inseparable aspects of process."

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Speculative / Conceptually Testable. As a fundamental metaphysical framework, direct empirical testing is limited, but it provides a conceptual basis for interpreting the emergent complexity observed in nature.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Process Theory, especially Whitehead's panexperientialism, aims to solve the combination problem faced by substance-property panpsychism by fundamentally redefining the nature of components and combination itself. Critics often struggle with the definition of fundamental 'events' and the metaphysical necessity of a cosmic actuality.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "Requires a complete overhaul of classical substance ontology (replacing 'things' with 'events'). Ambiguity exists in precisely defining the line between simple experience in events and complex, high-level consciousness.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within its own monistic metaphysical framework, providing an elegant and expansive model for integrating creativity, novelty, experience, and physics without relying on reductive materialism or bifurcated dualism."

    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Possible/Conditional",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is rooted in 'experiential creativity' and 'concrescence,' artificial systems could be conscious if they embody the required self-creative, dipolar relational processes, demonstrating genuine 'becoming.'"
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Possible/Conditional",
      "rationale": "The individual is composed of experiential events (occasions). While the individual body dissolves, the underlying universal process (God/Creativity) is eternal and preserves/re-incarnates the cumulative process, making some form of persistence likely, though perhaps not strictly of the original personal consciousness."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Cosmic/Intrinsic",
      "rationale": "Reality is intrinsically teleological, driven by the ultimate aim of 'creative advance' and 'novelty.' The universe itself is seen as striving toward increased complexity and value/being."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Uncertain",
      "rationale": "Virtual immortality requires perfectly duplicating a subjective, partially self-creative process rooted in a unique historical flow ('concrescence'). Simple duplication of a static state is likely insufficient to replicate the living, dynamic experience."
