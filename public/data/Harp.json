    "summary": "This theory claims that individual consciousness exists attached to a mind and body, experiencing states in a causal sequence. Through contemplative practices, consciousness can detach to experience the entire universe simultaneously in a shared, static state called Universal or God Consciousness. It seeks to unify theoretical physics and mystical teachings.",
