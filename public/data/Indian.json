    "theory_title": "Indian Dualism Theory",
    "summary": "This theory, derived from the ancient Samkhya school of Indian philosophy, posits a strict metaphysical dualism between two eternal, fundamental realities: *purusha* (sentient consciousness or spirit) and *prakriti* (insentient nature or matter). The mind and body are subtle and gross forms of *prakriti*, appearing conscious only because the *purusha* illuminates them as the passive witness-consciousness.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness (*purusha*) is identified as the eternal, absolute, independent, sentient spirit or self. It is distinct from all material aspects of reality, including the mind, which is merely subtle matter.",
    "ontological_status": "Metaphysical Dualism (specifically, between purusha/consciousness and prakriti/matter)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "The mind is a subtle material entity (*prakriti*) that acts as an internal organ (antaḥkaraṇa). It is passively illuminated by the *purusha* (the non-material consciousness), making it appear conscious, without the two being identical or reducible.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive",
    "emergence_type": "N/A",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (sentience) is the inherent nature of the *purusha*, which serves as the witness-consciousness. Intentionality (e.g., thoughts, will) resides in the mind (*prakriti*), which gains the appearance of consciousness through illumination by the *purusha*.",
    "qualia_account": "The qualitative feel is accounted for by the *purusha*'s role as the sentient witness-consciousness, which illuminates the insentient mind (where sensory discriminations and experiences reside), thereby making them conscious experiences.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Two fundamental, universal, and distinct realities: *purusha* (conscious spirit) and *prakriti* (unconscious nature/matter, including the mind).",
    "epistemic_access": "The *purusha* itself is absolute, beyond perception, and impossible to describe in words, suggesting non-empirical access (e.g., philosophical realization). The effects of its interaction with the mind are observed via subjective experience.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic building blocks are eternal individual units of consciousness (*purusha*) and insentient *prakriti* (composed of the three *gunas*)."
  },
  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal consciousness (sentient experience) and the self.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Illumination/Reflection. Consciousness itself (*purusha*) does not act, but its 'light' reflects upon the material mind, enabling the appearance of experience.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "The appearance of conscious functioning is achieved by the reflection or 'light' of the static, fundamental *purusha* upon the dynamic, evolvable modifications of *prakriti* (the mind). Consciousness itself is fundamental, not dynamically emergent.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The *purusha* is individual (each person is an individual consciousness), non-extended, and fundamentally distinct from the spatially extended body/brain (which is *prakriti*).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The functional role of *purusha* is primarily that of a witness or experiencer. Although the mind and body are active, the *purusha* confers the necessary sentience without which the activities would be purely mechanistic and unconscious.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The unification of experience is achieved through the unitary nature of the individual *purusha*, which illuminates the entire mind/body complex as a whole.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is processed by the internal organ or mind (*antaḥkaraṇa*, a material component). This processing is then made sentient by the illuminating presence of *purusha*.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness (*purusha*) is eternal and uncreated. Only *prakriti* (nature/matter), including the mind, undergoes evolution and modification.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (matter) are two fundamental, universal, and distinct realities.",
      "The mind (antaḥkaraṇa) is subtle matter that appears conscious only due to the illumination from the purusha.",
      "Purusha is absolute, independent, sentient, and acts as the passive witness-consciousness."

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Speculative/Philosophical. The central claim involves a non-material entity (*purusha*) that is not accessible to standard scientific observation or empirical testing.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Faces the classic problem of interactionism: explaining the causal mechanism by which a nonphysical, eternal substance (*purusha*) illuminates or relates to a physical, transient substance (*prakriti*). Also challenged on how insentient matter (the mind) can produce cognitive content and intentionality.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The specific nature and mechanism of the 'illumination' whereby the non-material *purusha* interacts with the subtle material mind to confer consciousness remains unexplained. The *purusha* itself is beyond conventional description.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Internally coherent within its founding premises as a metaphysical dualism. Incompatible with strict modern physicalism and materialism due to the assertion of an irreducible, nonphysical substance."

    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Consciousness (*purusha*) is an eternal, non-material substance. Since AI systems are products of matter (*prakriti*), they would necessarily lack the fundamental *purusha* required for true sentience."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "The *purusha* (consciousness/spirit) is eternal, existing independently of the body and mind, and is the basis for personal identity across cycles of birth, death, and rebirth (reincarnation)."
    },
    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Cosmic/Existential",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is a fundamental reality, implying an ultimate cosmic order, although purpose is often framed by Indian traditions in terms of liberation from the cycle of rebirth rather than a physical world teleology."
    },
    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Virtual immortality requires duplicating the mental self by capturing neural patterns, but this dualistic theory requires a separate, nonphysical substance (*purusha*) that cannot be duplicated or uploaded through material processes."
