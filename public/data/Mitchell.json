    "summary": "This theory asserts that free will, or agency, is a real phenomenon that emerges entirely from the purely physical workings of the brain. It emphasizes the evolutionary path through which nervous systems developed the capacity for learning, modeling, predicting, and simulating, allowing living beings to make real choices.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The theory is contested by hard determinists and skeptics of free will. It is significant precisely because it defends 'real' free will while maintaining an uncompromising commitment to physicalism, distinguishing it from many other materialist views.",
