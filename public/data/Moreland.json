    "summary": "This theory defends generic substance dualism, asserting that consciousness resides in a substantial, wholly immaterial soul which is distinct from the physical body. The soul acts as the unified, enduring bearer of conscious properties, grounding personal identity and animating the physical structure of the body.",

    "mind_body_relationship": "The soul is a substantial, unified reality that informs (gives form to) its body, animates it, and makes it human. The body is an ensouled, spatially extended physical structure, but the soul is required for it to be a functioning person.",

    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity, self-awareness, and intentionality are grounded in the soul as the non-physical, fundamental bearer of conscious properties, which is indivisible and enduring.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are properties of the immaterial soul, which uniquely accounts for the single, unitary awareness of conscious experience that materialist theories of the aggregate brain cannot explain.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Immaterial soul (substantial, unified, non-spatial in essence) and physical body/brain (material substance).",
    "epistemic_access": "Primarily through philosophical arguments concerning personal identity and necessity, supported by human introspection and common philosophical intuitions.",

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The soul's inherent unity (being non-aggregate) uniquely enables the fundamental unity of consciousness (e.g., single awareness of the visual field) that materialism cannot account for.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is fundamental to the soul; the soul itself is an ultimate, non-material reality, distinct from matter.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The consciousness resides in the immaterial soul, which informs and is fully present within its physical body during life.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The soul has causal power over the physical body (Interactive Dualism implied by the defense against materialist arguments) and grounds the long-term persistence of the person (diachronic endurance).",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is solved by the fundamental, non-aggregate unity of the soul, which inherently binds conscious experiences into a single subjective awareness.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Conscious states are properties of the immaterial soul and are not fully reducible to or explainable by physical processes or information flow in the brain.",

      "The self is a wholly immaterial substance, not reducible to the physical body.",

    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise mechanism of psycho-physical causation remains unexplained, which is the main challenge for all forms of interactive dualism.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent within its prescribed framework of generic substance dualism and consistent with the belief systems of Abrahamic religions, but incompatible with physicalism's assertion of the causal closure of the physical."
