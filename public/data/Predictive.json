    "summary": "This perspective views the brain as a dynamic prediction engine where conscious perception is generated internally by combining top-down expectations (predictions) with bottom-up sensory data (prediction errors). Consciousness arises as a functional mechanism that facilitates accurate prediction, awareness, and responsive behavior for survival.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as the complex synthesis of predictive expectation and sensory input, arising from top-down signaling that conveys predictions about the causes of sensory input.",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind (conscious perception) is a function or process rooted entirely in physical brain mechanisms (predictive processing), mediating the experience of body and world.",

    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity arises from the internal synthesis of prediction and sensation, enabling awareness and responsiveness. Intentionality (directedness of thought) is inherent in the system's focus on anticipating outcomes and minimizing prediction errors.",
    "qualia_account": "The theory primarily focuses on the function and process of perception via prediction. Qualia are implicitly related to the internal models or representations generated by the predictive brain, though the subjective 'feel' remains a challenge for the purely mechanistic view.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Biological brains, predictive models, sensory signals, expectation errors, and top-down/bottom-up signaling pathways.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessed via developing a systematic understanding of prediction as a core operating principle of the brain, analyzing how sensory data is integrated with pre-existing beliefs ('priors').",

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal (Perception), Cognition, Action, Awareness, Responsiveness",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle is continuous minimization of prediction errors (Bayesian inference approximation), where consciousness is associated with the active, top-down predictive signaling in the brain.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness dynamically emerges, facilitating the crucial biological capacity to predict and respond to the environment continuously.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Brain-based, distributed in neural networks involved in top-down signaling and recurrent pathways, cautioning against a purely 'skull-bound' neurocentric view.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness facilitates adaptive behavior and selection of optimal actions by enabling rapid comparison between real-world events and counterfactual simulations. The overarching function is survival by minimizing environmental 'surprise'.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved through the continuous synthesis of predictive expectations and incoming sensory information, resulting in coherent perception.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information flows via top-down signals conveying predictions and bottom-up signals conveying prediction errors, approximating Bayesian inference.",

    "testability_status": "Empirically testable (conditional on specific mechanistic models, e.g., related to the Free-Energy Principle).",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "Implied methods involve measuring neurological responses related to predictive coding and testing the dynamics of expectation errors (e.g., studies related to Active Inference).",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The main criticism, common for functional theories, is the failure to explain the subjective 'why'—why the process of prediction and synthesis should result in felt experience (qualia) rather than just functional output.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The core limitation is bridging the gap between the functional/computational description of prediction and the phenomenal realization of consciousness. The model focuses heavily on 'how' the brain works rather than 'what' consciousness fundamentally is.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly consistent with materialist, functionalist, and emergentist ontologies."
