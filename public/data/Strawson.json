    "theory_title": "Strawson’s Panpsychism Theory",
    "summary": "Strawson argues that any philosopher taking a realistic view of physicalism must accept that all physical phenomena are intrinsically experiential or phenomenal, leading to panpsychism (or panexperientialism) as a necessary conclusion of 'Real Materialism'. The existence of conscious experience, being the most certain fact, cannot be denied by genuine physicalism .",

    "ontological_status": "Realistic Monism / Real Materialism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Identity Theory (Strong Sense). Mental phenomena are considered concrete physical phenomena because real physicalism encompasses all real phenomena, including experience.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive/Fundamental",
    "emergence_type": "N/A (Consciousness is primitive). The theory relies on the impossibility of 'radical' emergence to support its claim that panpsychism is entailed by physicalism .",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "The subjective character of experience ('what-it-is-like' features) is a concrete, fundamental given natural fact that must be recognized by any realistic physicalist.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are real, concrete, and physical properties of the world; their denial is considered the 'silliest claim ever made'.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical ultimates (energy/physical stuff) and phenomenal/experiential properties that are inherent to them.",
    "epistemic_access": "Primarily through introspection (experience is the phenomenon whose existence is most certain) and philosophical argument, by which panpsychism is logically derived from a realistic understanding of physicalism.",

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal consciousness (experience/qualia).",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle that all concrete phenomena are physical, combined with the fact that experience is a concrete phenomenon and cannot radically emerge, dictates that experience is intrinsic to fundamental physics.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is fundamental, not dynamically emergent in the radical sense . If radical emergence is rejected, the theory supports panexperientialism .",
    "location_and_distribution": "Ubiquitous, associated with every part or aspect of physical reality, akin to fundamental fields and particles .",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness, being physical, fits unproblematically into the natural world. (The specific causal role of individual experiences is implied through their physical status but not detailed in the sources).",
    "integration_or_binding": "The theory faces the combination problem of panpsychism (how micro-level experiences combine into macroscopic conscious subjects). This problem must be solved for panpsychism to be the winning theory . (No specific solution mechanism is detailed by Strawson in the sources).",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "",
    "evolutionary_account": "Strawson accepts consciousness as physical, and suggests the appropriate response to its nature may be 'acceptance without expectation of understanding,' similar to wave-particle duality .",

    "testability_status": "Conceptually testable. It is a metaphysical proposal derived from philosophical premises about the nature of the physical world. Nagasawa notes that panpsychism, even if true, may reach a 'cognitive dead end' because it cannot be proven .",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Widely held to be 'absurd' by some critics . It suffers from the combination problem, requiring an explanation of how micro-level experiences aggregate to yield macrophenomenal properties.",

    "ontological_coherence": "Highly consistent within the proposed expanded definition of Materialism/Physicalism ('Realistic Monism'), aiming to solve the mind-body problem by integrating consciousness into ultimate physical reality."

    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Probably",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is an irreducible property of every elementary physical entity, then AI, being composed of physical matter, should also have inner awareness, provided the combination problem can be solved and micropsychic aspects can be manipulated by advanced technology ."

      "stance": "Unlikely (long shot)",
