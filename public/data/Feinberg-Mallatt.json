    "summary": "This theory proposes that phenomenal consciousness emerged much earlier in evolutionary history than often assumed, coinciding with the great Cambrian explosion 520–560 million years ago. It argues that the development of the first complex brains converted simple reflexive behaviors into a unified inner world of subjective experiences, meaning all vertebrates, and possibly some invertebrates, are conscious.",
