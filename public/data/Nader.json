    "summary": "This theory posits that consciousness is the ultimate primordial field and the singular fundamental existent. All perceived reality, including matter and individual minds, are limited perspectives or patterns of excitation through which this single Consciousness experiences itself. The theory uses a mathematical framework based on observer dynamics to formalize how these limited perspectives emerge.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as the most primordial field and the fundamental reality itself, from which the physical universe emerges.",
    "ontological_status": "Idealism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness is all there is; matter is real only as an appearance within consciousness or as an expression of consciousness itself, not as an independent entity.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive",
    "emergence_type": "Radical Emergence (of physical reality)",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity arises from the one Consciousness having different 'flavors' and experiencing itself through multiple limited perspectives. Existence (intentionality) requires a 'Bit of Consciousness' triple of Observerhood, Observinghood, and Observedhood.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are explained as the subjective richness and different 'flavors' or 'states' experienced by Consciousness through its limited perspectives.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Monistic field of Consciousness and 'Bits of Consciousness' (Observerhood, Observinghood, Observedhood triples).",
    "epistemic_access": "Known through the undeniable fact of personal awareness and introspective experience, formalized through a mathematical framework.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "Consciousness functions as a single field that expresses itself through quantifiable 'Bits of Consciousness,' which are specific triples representing the fundamental dynamic required for reality (observer, process, observed)."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Self-awareness, Cognition, and the ontological foundation of existence.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The systematization of awareness's inherent patterns of functioning (perceiving, discriminating, organizing) formalized by the mathematical 'Bit of Consciousness' axiom, which defines reality as self-experience.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "The single Consciousness differentiates into multiple, limited perspectives and subjective richness by systematically perceiving, discriminating, and organizing its own patterns of functioning.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Ubiquitous; consciousness is distributed as a singularity experiencing itself from limited perspectives; nothing exists outside the realm of observation.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is the ultimate source of causation, governing how its patterns manifest as reality. Its function is primary self-experience and allowing awareness to perceive and organize its own functioning.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Unity is maintained by the foundational premise that Consciousness is One. Individual experience is unified within its specific 'limited perspective' or 'Bit of Consciousness' boundary.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Mathematics provides the precise abstract representation of consciousness at work. The theoretical framework aims to systematize how human awareness perceives, discriminates, and organizes its patterns.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Not explicitly addressed. As consciousness is posited as the fundamental reality, the physical world's evolution would be considered a subsequent unfolding of conscious patterns, rather than a cause of consciousness.",

    "testability_status": "Conceptually testable",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "Explicit empirical interventions are not provided in the source; the theory tests its conceptual soundness by deriving consequences from axioms and comparing them against human experience and by attempting to resolve problems in existing physics.",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Faces the decomposition problem typical of idealism: explaining how distinct individual subjects (limited perspectives) arise from a fundamentally unitary Consciousness. Implicitly subject to the general criticism that idealism denies the objective reality of the physical world.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "Must demonstrate definitively how the physical universe emerges from fundamental consciousness and successfully resolve enduring conceptual problems in other scientific fields, such as quantum field theory.",
    "ontological_coherence": "High, as it establishes a complete monistic ontology where mind/consciousness is the singular basis of all existence, eliminating the mind-body problem by reduction of matter to appearance."
