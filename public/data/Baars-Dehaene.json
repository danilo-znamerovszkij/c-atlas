    "theory_title": "Baars’s and Dehaene’s Global Workspace Theory",
    "summary": "This theory posits that conscious awareness is constituted by specific multi-sensory, multi-cognitive information that achieves brain-wide presence and broad accessibility. It conceptualizes consciousness as an inner 'theater' where this information is globally broadcast, reconciling the limited capacity of momentary conscious content with vast long-term memory access.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as the instantaneous global availability and broad accessibility of specific, integrated information across numerous specialized modular systems in the brain.",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Identity/Correlation. The mind (conscious awareness) is identified as, or strongly correlates with, the specific, biologically realized processes of global information broadcasting in the brain.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence. As a core Materialist/Neurobiological theory , it assumes consciousness arises from complex but ultimately explainable biological brain functions, meaning that consciousness is reducible in principle.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity arises from the uniquely integrated contents of the global workspace ; intentionality (directedness of thought) is inherent in the multi-cognitive and goal-related information that gains access to the workspace.",
    "qualia_account": "Phenomenal experience (qualia) is accounted for by proposing a strictly biological mechanism for conscious awareness. Qualia correspond to the content of the integrated, reportable multi-sensory information that is broadly accessible within the global workspace.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Specific neural mechanisms, networks, and the physical substrate of consciousness (PSC), particularly the widespread and integrated patterns of information flow within the brain.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible via third-person methods including neuroimaging and computer modeling, which study the correlated brain activation patterns (e.g., global ignition events) corresponding to conscious experience.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "An inner 'theater' or workspace structure where information is selectively amplified and broadcast across a distributed network of specialized brain modules."

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Global broadcasting and accessibility of information, allowing a single coherent content to be made available to many specialized, unconscious modules simultaneously.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Conscious states are dynamic events that arise when information overcomes competition and is broadcast across the widespread cortical network (the global workspace).",
    "location_and_distribution": "Brain-wide, encompassing widespread areas, particularly associated with frontal and parietal regions (often characterized as a 'front of the head' theory in contrast to 'back of the head' theories like IIT).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Global broadcasting constitutes consciousness. Functionally, it allows for flexible control and reconciliation between limited momentary conscious content and long-term memory resources.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved by the broad, brain-wide broadcasting of a coherent 'total package' of information into the global workspace.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information flows from specialized modules, competes for global access, and, upon winning, is globally broadcast, making it available for cognitive processing by multiple systems.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Compatible (though GWT itself is mechanistic rather than phylogenetic). As a Materialist/Neurobiological theory, it implies consciousness arose via evolutionary mechanisms that selected for its cognitive utility, such as improved information management and flexible behavior.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Conscious awareness consists of the brain-wide presence and broad accessibility of specific multi-sensory, multi-cognitive information.",
      "Global broadcasting constitutes consciousness, rather than being merely caused by it.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Criticized for focusing on 'access' rather than genuine phenomenal experience, exemplified by the critique that the theory is 'all about access but not about seeing'. It faces tension regarding whether global broadcasting is necessary or merely a consequence of consciousness.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "Does not fully address the 'hard problem'—why the mechanism of global accessibility should result in qualitative subjective experience.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within a physicalist framework, relying only on established brain functions and information mechanisms to account for consciousness."

    "AI_consciousness": {

      "stance": "Humanistic only",
      "rationale": "As a Materialist/Neurobiological theory, it does not mandate ultimate cosmic meaning or purpose, but consciousness provides essential functions (like memory reconciliation and integrated awareness) that underpin human agency and self-created value."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is wholly explained by the computational organization and information flow of the brain, a perfect duplication or uploading of these mechanisms into a non-biological substrate should preserve the first-person mental self."
