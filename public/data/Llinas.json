    "summary": "This theory posits that the conscious \"mindness state\" is fundamentally generated by electrical oscillations within neurons and the resulting simultaneous activity across distant neural groups, which forms the neurobiological root of cognition. It suggests that reality, as experienced, is a kind of virtual reality generated by these internal oscillations, which primarily function to enable prediction.",
