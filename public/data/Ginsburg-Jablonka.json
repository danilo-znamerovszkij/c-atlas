    "theory_title": "Ginsburg and Jablonka’s Associative Learning During Evolution",
    "summary": "This theory proposes that the driving force in the transition to basic or minimal consciousness during evolution was the acquisition of complex learning capabilities. The specific marker is 'unlimited associative learning,' which enables an organism to attribute motivational value to novel, complex stimuli or actions for future learning.",

    "qualia_account": "Qualia (basic/minimal phenomenal experience) are implied as properties resulting from the successful function of unlimited associative learning, although the exact qualitative feel is not explicitly detailed in the source material.",

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Gradual, incremental development over phylogenetic timescales, driven by the selection pressures favoring increasingly flexible and complex learning abilities.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized in the biological neural structures of organisms capable of unlimited associative learning.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness, driven by UAL, enables adaptive behavior, survival, and flexible learning regarding novel environmental cues and internal motivational states.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is implicitly achieved through the complex processing necessary for UAL to link disparate external stimuli and internal motivational states.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information flow involves processing novel, complex stimuli and associating them with motivational value, which is then used as stored information for future learning.",

      "stance": "Humanistic only",
      "rationale": "Consistent with Materialism Theories, consciousness is an adaptive evolutionary trait, providing organizational benefits, but implying no ultimate cosmic meaning or purpose beyond human-created value."
