    "summary": "This theory links quantum field theory applied to brain functioning with the continental postphenomenological tradition, proposing a new ontology of non-Cartesian dual modes. It resolves the problematics of qualia and the quantum measurement problem by substituting 'disclosure' for perceptual consciousness, distinguishing the phenomenal brain from the macroscopic quantum brain object.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Phenomenal reality is identified not as consciousness per se, but as 'dis-closure' arising from the transition out of primary 'closure' (the nonphenomenality of quantum physical reality), mediated by dissipative quantum thermofield brain dynamics.",
    "ontological_status": "Idealist/Monistic (Non-Cartesian Dual Modes). The theory revives a version of monadology, suggesting that each brain performs a 'continual creation' of its world in parallel.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "The mind-body problem is resolved by substituting disclosure for perceptual consciousness and separating the phenomenal brain (brain-p) from the macroscopic quantum object brain (brain-q), relying on dual modes whose connection is their 'between'.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent (via Dis-closure). Disclosure is the action that brings the phenomenal world out of quantum physical reality (closure).",
    "emergence_type": "Not specified, but the complex, non-reductive mechanism of dis-closure from a fundamental quantum reality implies Strong Emergence of the phenomenal domain.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is handled through the disclosed world, which is a continual creation of the quantum thermofield brain. The brain is 'triply tuned' by sensory input, memory, and self-tuning, enabling the internal match required for disclosure.",
    "qualia_account": "The theory claims to resolve the hard problem of qualia by incorporating it, along with the quantum measurement problem, into the framework of dissipative quantum thermofield brain dynamics/disclosure.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Quantum physical reality (closure), dissipative quantum thermofield brain dynamics, phenomenal brain-p, macroscopic quantum object brain-q, and non-Cartesian dual modes.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessed through the unification of theoretical quantum field theory applied to brain function and the analysis provided by continental postphenomenology.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic structure involves quantum field theory mechanisms applied to the brain (quantum brain dynamics) that dynamically transition from nonphenomenal closure to phenomenal disclosure."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal consciousness (replaced by disclosure) and qualia.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle of 'dis-closure,' which arises from dissipative quantum thermofield brain dynamics, substituting perceptual consciousness.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness/disclosure is a dynamic process of 'continual creation' by the quantum thermofield brain, which achieves an internal match through multiple tuning (sensory input, memory, self-tuning).",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized to the quantum thermofield brain.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The functional role is disclosure of a world through internal matching, not computation or information processing, as the brain 'does not primarily process information—does not compute'.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved via the system's 'multiple tunability' resulting in an 'internal match'.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "The theory posits the brain does not primarily process information or compute. The emphasis is on achieving an internal match through tuning.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Not addressed. Based on the theory's focus on fundamental quantum ontology and monadology, evolution is likely secondary or implicit in the continual creation process.",

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Highly speculative/Conceptually testable. It relies on complex interpretations of quantum physics and deep philosophical reframing that is difficult to translate into conventional empirical experiments.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Criticized for combining two persistently controversial areas (the hard problem and the quantum measurement problem). The approach is highly abstract and relies on concepts like 'disclosure' that replace conventional notions of consciousness.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "Requires fully explicating the dynamics of the non-Cartesian dual modes and the specific mechanism by which quantum dynamics lead to disclosure.",

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Uncertain/Conditional",
      "rationale": "The theory argues that the brain does not compute. If consciousness relies strictly on non-computational, dissipative quantum thermofield dynamics instantiated in biological 'wetware,' artificial intelligence would be unlikely to replicate it unless non-biological substrates could realize the same precise quantum dynamics."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Possibly",
      "rationale": "The theory involves a monadological view of reality as continual creation, suggesting a complex fundamental ontology that might permit persistence beyond the classical physical body, aligning with other non-materialist Quantum Theories."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Inherently Metaphysical/Possible",
      "rationale": "The reliance on a monadological, continually creating ontology suggests a non-deflationary view of existence, implying potential inherent meaning derived from the disclosed world, contrasting sharply with physicalist viewpoints."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Virtual immortality relies on computational functionalism (uploading data/algorithms), which is explicitly opposed by the theory's claim that the brain 'does not compute' and phenomenal reality depends on specific quantum field dynamics."
