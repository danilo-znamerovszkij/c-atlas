    "summary": "Neurophenomenology is a methodological approach that seeks to establish mutual constraints between first-person phenomena present in lived experience (phenomenology) and third-person neural phenomena established by cognitive sciences. The goal is to marry rigorous science with a disciplined examination of human experience, placing the structure of experience at the core of the scientific inquiry.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The approach is often overlooked or misunderstood. The challenge is ensuring that the reciprocal direction—from experience guiding science—is not ignored in practice. It seeks to supersede the dualist thought style, which some critics might find insufficiently reductive or insufficiently dualistic.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The framework aims to dissolve the hard problem existentially/methodologically, meaning it does not offer a traditional intellectual solution for the physical origin of primary consciousness.",
    "ontological_coherence": "High, as the framework is specifically designed to overcome the bifurcation problem and explanatory gap inherent in dualist models by harmonizing two distinct domains (first-person and third-person) through methodical constraint."
