    "summary": "This framework, common across mystical and religious traditions, posits that the individual soul is a permanent, nonphysical entity that exists in multiple dimensions or levels before, during, and after physical life. The core conscious experience is considered derivative of this primitive, nonphysical soul substance, thereby establishing consciousness itself as nonphysical.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is derivative of the nonphysical soul or spirit, which is defined as a permanent, primitive entity (a nonphysical substance).",
    "ontological_status": "Substance Dualism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Interactionist/Correlational. The mind (soul) is the nonphysical substance, while the body is physical. The nature of their interaction is complex, often mysterious, but their persistence beyond physical dissolution is assumed.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive (The soul/spirit entity is described as primitive and permanent, fundamental to reality, not emergent from matter.)",
    "emergence_type": "N/A (Consciousness is derivative of a primitive nonphysical soul; emergence from matter is rejected.)",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is an intrinsic property of the nonphysical soul/spirit entity, which persists as the bearer of first-person perspective; intentionality is tied to the soul's internal structure and purpose.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are nonphysical properties inherent to the soul/spirit, carried by this nonphysical substance, which is required for subjective experience.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Nonphysical substance (soul/spirit); physical matter (body); and multi-level, multi-dimensional realms or structures in which the soul exists and journeys.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessed through introspection, mystical or spiritual experience, religious traditions and texts, and evidence from anomalous phenomena (such as NDEs and OBEs).",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The core constituent is the nonphysical soul or spirit, often organized into complex, multi-level, multi-dimensional, geometric structures, or 'habitats' (realms)."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Self-awareness, Survival Beyond Death, Spiritual Evolution, Identity.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle is the persistence and spiritual progression of the nonphysical soul entity through elaborate levels or realms of existence before and after physical life.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is perpetually associated with the permanent soul substance, which 'journeys' or evolves across various dimensions and timeframes, rather than emerging dynamically from physical processes.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized to the individual nonphysical soul/spirit; distributed across various spiritual, multi-dimensional 'realms' or 'habitats'.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The soul is the bearer of conscious properties and serves the function of accommodating spiritual journeys and persistence beyond physical death. The nonphysical nature of the soul ensures personal consciousness is nonphysical.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The unity of experience is fundamentally provided by the indivisible and unified nature of the nonphysical soul substance itself.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is codified within the structure of the soul, determining its unique properties and potential. In some interpretations, the soul is an 'information entity' structurally part of the foundational informational realms of the cosmos.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The soul is typically viewed as primitive and permanent, existing before physical life. Evolution is often conceived spiritually or morally, as the soul progresses through various realms or incarnations.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "The soul is a nonphysical substance that is primitive and permanent, making personal consciousness nonphysical.",
      "The soul exists in elaborate levels, stages, or realms, accommodating pre-birth and post-death journeys.",

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Largely speculative and non-scientific. The mechanisms of nonphysical realms and soul interactions are not subject to standard empirical methodologies, though associated phenomena (NDEs/OBEs) are studied.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "Associated phenomena, such as Near-Death Experiences (NDEs) and Out-of-Body Experiences (OBEs), are investigated through case collection and physiological studies conducted by research groups like DOPS.",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Suffers from the fundamental philosophical problems associated with substance dualism, including the causal interaction problem (how the nonphysical soul interacts with the physical body) and lack of parsimony. It is often dismissed by mainstream scientific and philosophical communities as non-rational or mythological.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise essence and composition of the nonphysical soul/spirit substance are unknown. The mechanism by which the soul is tethered to a body and travels between dimensions remains unexplained.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within its own metaphysical framework (Dualism/Religious Idealism), as it intentionally sets consciousness outside the physical domain to explain persistent subjectivity and post-mortem survival. It is radically inconsistent with physicalist ontologies."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "No (Mostly)",
      "rationale": "If consciousness requires a radically separate, nonphysical substance (soul) that is typically created or allocated by God or predetermined laws, artificial systems cannot instantiate true inner awareness. Emergent dualism could be an exception, but this traditional view usually implies divine or natural allocation."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "Dualism provides the clearest mechanism for survival because the nonphysical soul/spirit is independent of the body, allowing for post-mortem existence and journeys through various multi-dimensional realms (such as resurrection or reincarnation)."
    },
    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Cosmic/Ultimate",
      "rationale": "As a form of religious or traditional dualism, this view inherently links consciousness to a nonphysical or divine ultimate reality, providing ultimate meaning, purpose, and value tied to the soul's eternal journey or destiny."
    },
    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Not Needed",
      "rationale": "Since the nonphysical soul is the true self and is permanent, achieving 'real' survival beyond death, a virtual or simulated duplication of the mind in a machine would be moot or unnecessary."
