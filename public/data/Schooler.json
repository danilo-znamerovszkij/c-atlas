    "theory_title": "Schooler’s Resonance Theory and Subjective Time",
    "summary": "This theory combines two novel ideas: a resonance mechanism, where consciousness arises from the interaction of multiple levels or streams of awareness, and the hypothesis that conscious experience is linked to an observer's movement through objective time relative to an unacknowledged dimension of subjective time. This framework is motivated by research into meta-consciousness and anomalous cognition.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as the changing informational states associated with an observer’s movement through objective time relative to a subjective dimension of time. It is structured by multiple interacting levels of awareness connected via resonance.",
    "ontological_status": "Extended Physicalism/Panpsychism. The theory finds panpsychism plausible and posits a subjective dimension of time as a new, real dimension of existence.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness interfaces with the physical brain via resonance mechanisms. The mind, through its connection to subjective time, has unexplained aspects that transcend standard physicalist constraints, possibly supporting anomalous cognition.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent. Consciousness is considered to emerge as an integration of lower-level conscious entities (consistent with panpsychist leanings) into a macroscopic conscious experience.",
    "emergence_type": "Strong Emergence/Combination. The integration of low-level consciousnesses through shared resonance yields a complex conscious experience, a phenomenon whose qualitative nature is fundamentally novel and irreducible to individual parts.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is central, realized as multiple vantage points or 'nested observer windows' (a Cartesian Multiplex) and fundamentally tied to the subjective dimension of time and the experience of 'now'. Intentionality is implicitly linked to the processing of changing informational states within this structure.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (qualitative feel) are acknowledged as the subjective experience which may forever elude full objective scientific scrutiny. Complex conscious experience, rich in qualia, is constructed through shared resonance between different nested windows of awareness.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Multiple levels of consciousness (windows/streams); a subjective dimension of time; neural structures supporting resonance; the potential reality of anomalous cognition (psi phenomena).",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible via introspection (for qualia and subjective time perception) and through rigorous third-person methods focusing on meta-consciousness research, mind wandering, and disciplined investigation of anomalous phenomena.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic structure is the 'Cartesian Multiplex': a set of multiple, nested observer windows or streams of consciousness operating simultaneously within the brain, interconnected and unified by various forms of resonance."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Access, Self-awareness (meta-consciousness), Subjective time flow, Anomalous cognition (psi phenomena).",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Shared resonance (including cross-frequency coupling) enabling instantaneous communication and integration across multiple levels of consciousness, combined with the presence of a subjective dimension of time.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness dynamically arises via a phase transition in the speed and bandwidth of information flows among constituent parts enabled by shared resonance. It is the changing informational state resulting from movement through the temporal dimensions.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Distributed across neural structures (windows/streams) capable of resonance (e.g., in the left and right hemispheres of the brain), and conceptually extended via an unacknowledged dimension of subjective time.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Functions to unify complex experience (macroscopic consciousness). Involvement with anomalous cognition suggests a causal role that interfaces with reality beyond the constraints of objective space-time, potentially enabling precognition.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved through shared resonance among different levels of consciousness (windows), which allows constituent parts to communicate and create a richer, unified conscious experience.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is central: consciousness is theorized to arise from the continually changing informational states linked to temporal movement. Resonance mediates the speed and bandwidth of information flows between neural parts.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The theory focuses on the functional dynamics of consciousness rather than its phylogenetic history, though the mechanisms outlined (e.g., efficient information flow) would presumably provide an adaptive benefit.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Consciousness is structured by multiple, nested levels of awareness forming a 'Cartesian Multiplex'.",
      "The subjective experience of unity and richness arises from shared resonance leading to phase transitions in information flow.",

    ],
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The theory faces strong skepticism for its inclusion of anomalous cognition and its endorsement of a 'Cartesian Theater' (Multiplex), which conflicts with strong deflationary models. Psi claims often suffer from replication failures.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The existence and mechanics of the subjective dimension of time are an acknowledged frontier. Furthermore, the theory concedes that aspects of subjective experience (qualia) may remain outside the bounds of full objective scientific explanation.",
    "ontological_coherence": "High internal coherence: the mechanisms (resonance) and anomalous observations (precognition) are linked via the subjective time concept. It aligns poorly with classical reductive physicalism but is compatible with expanded ontologies like panpsychism."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "This theory belongs to a category (AAST) which supports an expanded reality and often gives credence to some form of existence or state of consciousness after biological death, supported by its reliance on non-physical temporal aspects."
    },
    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Possible",
      "rationale": "By positing an expanded reality and a subjective temporal dimension related to consciousness, the theory suggests potential for new kinds or levels of ultimate meaning and purpose beyond reductive accounts."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Not needed/Uncertain",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is fundamentally non-local or tied to a subjective temporal dimension that persists after bodily death (supporting survival), digital uploading or simulation is either unnecessary or insufficient to capture the core 'self'."
