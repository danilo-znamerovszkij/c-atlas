    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "The universe minimally possesses some kind of experience or consciousness. Certain forms, like Agent Cosmopsychism, suggest the universe is a value-responding agent with goal-directed intent.",

    "ontological_commitments": "The existence of one fundamental conscious entity: the universe (the cosmos).",

    "integration_or_binding": "The theory solves Panpsychism’s combination problem by adopting a top-down priority. Since the consciousness of the cosmos is ontologically prior, it avoids the difficulty of explaining how micro-level consciousnesses combine to form macro-level consciousness.",
