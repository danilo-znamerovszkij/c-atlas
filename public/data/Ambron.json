    "summary": "This hypothesis suggests that consciousness, particularly phenomenal experience like pain, arises when neurophysiological information (action potentials) is transformed into electromagnetic (EM) waves. The integration of information across these EM waves is proposed as the mechanism that solves the binding problem, yielding a unified conscious experience.",
