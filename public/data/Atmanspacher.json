    "summary": "This theory posits that mind (mental domain) and matter (material domain) are inseparable manifestations, or aspects, of a single underlying, fundamental, psychophysically neutral reality. The mental and physical domains emerge dynamically by breaking the holistic symmetry of this fundamental reality, leading to mutual correlations between them.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness (the mental domain) is identified as one of two irreducible aspects emerging from an underlying, non-material, psychophysically neutral domain, which is the singular fundamental reality.",
    "ontological_status": "Neutral Monism / Dual-Aspect Monism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind and matter are inseparable aspects of the underlying neutral reality and are jointly caused by it. They manifest mutual correlations (like synchronicity) that reflect the lost holism of the underlying domain (decompositional view).",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Strong Emergence",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is one aspect (the mental domain) emerging from the underlying reality. Intentionality is tied to the deep structure of meaning inherent in the underlying reality, possibly via archetypes.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are properties of the irreducible mental domain emerging from the neutral reality. The qualitative dimension is crucial, reflected in the emphasis on qualitative meaning (synchronicity) over quantitative statistics (entanglement) in linking the aspects.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Psychophysically neutral domain (holistic, underlying reality), mental domain, material domain, mind-matter correlations, archetypes.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible through epistemic discernment of the separate mental and material domains, contrasted with the ontic existence of the neutral domain. Progress is suggested by investigating mental quantum features without associated brain activity initially.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic building block is the dynamic, holistic, psychophysically neutral domain (analogous to Bohm’s implicate order), from which the mental and physical states unfold (explication)."

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Mental and physical domains emerge dynamically via explication (unfoldment) from the underlying reality, which is characterized as dynamic (contrasting with static views).",
    "location_and_distribution": "Consciousness (the mental domain) is globally associated with the underlying reality, manifesting as an aspect alongside the material domain.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The theory focuses on acausal correlations (synchronicity, linked to qualitative meaning) between the mental and physical domains, suggesting that the underlying neutral level jointly causes these aspects.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Unity is achieved because the underlying psychophysically neutral domain is fundamentally holistic and undivided, from which mind-matter entanglement and correlations hypothetically originate.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information processing is secondary to the deeper structure of meaning inherent in the underlying reality, which connects the mental and physical domains via acausal correlations.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The decompositional dual-aspect approach is based on speculations derived from quantum holism that clearly exceed the scope of contemporary quantum theory. It can be criticized as abstract and philosophical rather than empirically grounded.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise nature and mechanism of the psychophysically neutral domain, and how the theory relates concretely to empirical measurement in contemporary science, remain abstract and unsolved.",

    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Uncertain",
      "rationale": "Consciousness depends on emergence from the holistic psychophysically neutral domain via specific symmetry breaking. It is unclear whether artificial systems could replicate the non-computational ontological conditions necessary to tap into this underlying reality."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Possibly",

      "stance": "Uncertain",
      "rationale": "Virtual immortality via duplication relies on functionalism. Since consciousness is rooted in the dynamic, holistic emergence from the psychophysically neutral level, mere computational duplication of physical states would likely be insufficient to preserve the mental aspect."
