    "theory_title": "Cleeremans and Tallon-Baudryâ€™s Functional Value",
    "summary": "This theory suggests that phenomenal consciousness evolved because it confers functional value by adding a critical degree of freedom to reward-based behavior. It proposes that subjective experience acts as a \"mental currency\" that assigns intrinsic value to conscious states, enabling the comparison and unification of diverse experiences.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Phenomenal consciousness is identified as having intrinsic functional value, acting as a mental currency that endows conscious states with worth for behavioral optimization.",
    "ontological_status": "Materialism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness is an evolved biological feature tied to the neural machinery governing reward-based behavior. The relationship seeks to reduce the hard problem to a problem of function.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity arises from the requirement for a common, subject-centered space necessary to compare and value diverse experiences ('mental currency'). Intentionality is implicitly tied to goal-directed, reward-based behavior.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (phenomenal experience) are accounted for functionally by possessing intrinsic value, which allows the reduction of the hard problem to a problem about function.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Biological mechanisms supporting reward-based behavior; systems capable of comparing and valuing internal states.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible via the study of how phenomenal experience provides functional value in decision-making, emotion research, and consciousness research.",

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Functional Value, Unified experience",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The phenomenal worthiness hypothesis posits that consciousness evolved by granting intrinsic value ('mental currency') to experiences, enabling cross-comparison of vastly different needs and optimizing decision-making in reward-based contexts.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness arose through phylogenetic evolution and selection, adding an important degree of freedom to the existing machinery of reward-based behavior.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized in organisms possessing the necessary biological machinery for reward-based learning and comparison of intrinsic values.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness plays an active, causal role. Its functional role is to provide a common currency (intrinsic value) for comparing diverse, potentially competing, subjective states to optimize behavior.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Unification is achieved because the phenomenal experience is housed in a common subject-centered space that facilitates the comparison of all intrinsic values simultaneously.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information streams representing diverse experiences are processed and assigned intrinsic value (phenomenal worthiness) for comparison and regulation of behavior.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness evolved and was selected because it provides functional advantage by adding a degree of freedom to reward-based behavior, optimizing survival and exploration.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Phenomenal consciousness has functional value, rejecting the classical epiphenomenal view.",

    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "Measures studying the relationship between subjective reports of intrinsic value, unification of experience, and decision-making in reward-based contexts.",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Nonmaterialists criticize this theory for attempting to reduce the hard problem to a problem about function, finding this inadequate to explain the qualitative aspect of experience itself.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The primary limitation is providing a mechanistic account of *why* functional value feels like something, rather than merely stating that this feeling has functional utility.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within a materialist ontology, as it aims to reduce phenomenal experience to an empirically evolved and functionally beneficial biological property."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "As a materialist theory focused on function and evolved mechanisms, if the machinery enabling intrinsic valuation and comparison (the mental currency) can be realized in artificial substrates, AI consciousness is possible."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is an evolved property of biological machinery tied to the functional necessities of the organism, consistent with the materialist rejection of post-mortem survival."
    },
    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Humanistic only",
      "rationale": "Consciousness serves an adaptive and biological purpose (optimizing reward-based behavior), implying no ultimate cosmic meaning, aligning with Materialism."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "Given its strong functionalist roots under Materialism, virtual immortality would be attainable in principle if the relevant functional dynamics and mechanisms responsible for assigning intrinsic value could be duplicated non-biologically."
