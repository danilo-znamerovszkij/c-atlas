    "summary": "This theory posits that cognitive processes are not strictly confined to the biological brain but extend into the external environment (active externalism). When a human organism links with an external entity in a two-way interaction, a coupled system is formed that acts as a cognitive system in its own right. Removing the external component degrades the system's behavioral competence, much like removing part of the brain.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as a function of the entire coupled cognitive system, encompassing both internal neural processes and external tools/environment, emphasizing its dependence on active externalism.",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism (Functionalist/Relational)",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Correlation/Extension. The mind is an emergent property or functional process distributed across the brain, body, and relevant environment, challenging the traditional view that the mind is skull-bound.",

    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "The sources focus primarily on the functional role of cognition and behavioral competence, not explicitly how phenomenal subjectivity or intentionality arise. Subjectivity is implicitly treated as a feature of the functioning cognitive system, wherever it is located.",
    "qualia_account": "The theory focuses on the extension of cognitive processes and achieving behavioral competence, but the sources do not explicitly detail how phenomenal qualia (the qualitative dimension of experience) are accounted for or extended within the coupled system.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Brain, body, external objects/tools, and the physical environment, all participating in an active causal role within the coupled system.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible via studying the two-way interaction and active causal role of all components in the coupled system, focusing on behavioral competence and cognitive circuits.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "A 'coupled system' composed of the human organism (brain and body) linked with external entities (social and material world) in a two-way interaction, forming a seamless, integrated whole."

    "causation_and_functional_role": "The components in the coupled system play an active causal role and jointly govern behavior, allowing the mind to facilitate adaptive interaction with the world.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration occurs through the active two-way interaction between the organism and the external entity, forming a seamless, integrated cognitive whole.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information processing relies on representations that are extended to include the participatory role of the environment in driving cognitive processes.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The theory is consistent with an evolutionary framework wherein the predictive capabilities of the brain are facilitated by awareness and conformity to external realities, suggesting an adaptive role for cognitive extension.",

      "stance": "Conditional",
      "rationale": "While rooted in Materialism (which generally denies survival), if the essential self is defined by a distributed, functional pattern that can persist regardless of its biological substrate, survival of that pattern might be possible."

      "stance": "Possible",
