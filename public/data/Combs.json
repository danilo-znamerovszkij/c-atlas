    "summary": "This theory models consciousness, particularly the continuous flow of subjective experience, using the concepts of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. It posits that consciousness operates as a chaotic autopoietic attractor—a self-creating and self-maintaining system where experiential elements, such as thoughts and emotions, spontaneously organize into coherent streams of experience, often functioning near the 'edge of chaos'.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as a chaotic autopoietic attractor, which is a self-generating, self-maintaining system that reflects the continuous flow and internal 'clinging together' of experiential elements (thoughts, memories, and emotions).",

    "emergence_type": "Dynamic Emergence. Consciousness emerges through the complex, self-organizing capabilities (autopoiesis) of the system, often operating at a highly sensitive state near the 'edge of chaos' or the brink of change.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is embodied in the coherent self-organizing streams of experience (the 'onflow of experiential lives'). Intentionality (directed thought) is implicitly structured by the dynamic patterns resulting from this complex autopoietic system.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia, or the elements of conscious experience (thoughts, memories, emotions), are the constituents that 'cling together' to form the distinct, self-perpetuating, and resilient attractor states of consciousness.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Chaotic attractors, nonlinear dynamics, autopoietic systems (self-maintaining biological/cognitive patterns), and associated neurochemistry.",
    "epistemic_access": "Consciousness is accessed through observation of complex self-organizing cognitive patterns and, primarily, through structural analysis and mathematical modeling of nonlinear dynamics and experiential flow (phenomenology).",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic constituents are thoughts, memories, and emotions, organized into structures defined by chaotic attractor patterns that constantly recreate themselves (autopoiesis)."

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle of the chaotic autopoietic attractor, which explains the dynamic cohesion and self-perpetuation of subjective experience, achieved by operating near the boundary between stability and chaos.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic, fluid process. States are characterized by 'periods of relative stability punctuated by phases of instability' (chaotic behavior), allowing the system to transition to new attractor patterns, reflecting change or bifurcation.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized to the physical system (organism/brain) capable of generating and maintaining the complex dynamic organization required for chaotic autopoietic attractor states, implied by the link to neurochemistry.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness serves to create coherent, self-organizing streams of experience. Emotional states, modeled as attractors, demonstrate resilience and self-propagation, suggesting a role in systemic maintenance and stability.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved through the fundamental nature of the chaotic attractor, ensuring that diverse elements of conscious experience ('multitude of ideas') 'cling together' to form a unified, coherent experiential carpet.",

    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Possibly",

      "stance": "Uncertain",
      "rationale": "The core mechanism (autopoiesis) is biologically defined. However, the theory is categorized under Anomalous/Altered States, which suggests a conceptual openness to expanded realities or forms of consciousness not strictly tied to the dying physical body."

      "stance": "Implied/Humanistic",
      "rationale": "The focus on consciousness as a self-creating, self-organizing system provides implicit meaning and value derived from the inherent coherence and resilience of the subjective stream, rather than a predetermined cosmic teleology."
