    "summary": "This view, based on an interpretation of William James's work, flips the paradigm of the Hard Problem by arguing that consciousness is not a mystery of subjective experience but an evolved mechanism designed to solve the 'selection problem'. This mechanism increases the organism's fitness by selecting for adaptive responses among a proliferation of options generated by a complex brain, favoring outcomes aligned with the brain's long-term interests.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as a selection mechanism that applies pressure in favor of performances making for the most permanent interests of the organism, rooted in the conferring of preferences for certain sensations (de facto ends).",
    "ontological_status": "Functionalist/Physicalist (Justified: The theory dissolves the Hard Problem by assigning consciousness a purely functional, adaptive role, aligning it with Materialism's goal of explaining consciousness solely through physical systems).",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness is functionally engaged with complex brain processes, specifically linked to the formation of 'cerebral reflexes' where preferences influence organism-environment interactions.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence (Justified: Consciousness emerges as an adaptive necessity when brain complexity leads to a proliferation of non-optimal response options, implying emergence from sophisticated physical organization).",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is handled functionally, as consciousness confers preferences for some sensations over others, thus determining the source of the organism's 'de facto ends' (intentional targets).",
    "qualia_account": "The Hard Problem (accounting for qualia or 'what-it-is-like') is essentially dissolved by shifting the focus to the functional problem consciousness solves (the selection problem).",
    "ontological_commitments": "Complex biological brains, environmental situations that require adaptive selection, and evolved psychological functions (selection mechanisms, preferences).",
    "epistemic_access": "Primarily accessed through the analysis of its functional role in increasing the organism's fitness and selecting behaviors (third-person evolutionary analysis).",
    "constituents_and_structure": "A complex brain structure capable of supporting a proliferation of response options, combined with an overlaid selection mechanism to prioritize adaptive outcomes."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Agency, selection of adaptive responses, conferring preferences (functional aspects of consciousness).",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The mechanism is consciousness acting as a selection pressure, ensuring complex behaviors favor the long-term, permanent interests of the organism.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "A dynamic process that arises in brains complex enough to create competing response options, serving to filter or select the most advantageous outcome, thus forming 'de facto ends' from preferred sensations.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Located in brains that have achieved sufficient complexity to face the 'selection problem'.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is causally effective by imposing pressure on performances that promote fitness; its function is to solve the 'selection problem' inherent in complex systems."

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The main conceptual tension is whether consciousness is truly a good fit, even prima facie, to address the 'selection problem' as described.",

      "stance": "Pragmatic",
