    "summary": "This theory presents the brain as a self-organized system and a ‘foretelling device’ that continuously generates intrinsic patterns and rhythms (neural syntax). Cognition is understood as internalized action that emerges when the brain disengages from its sensors to examine 'what happens if' scenarios. Meaning is later acquired when these internal patterns are grounded by action-based interactions with the environment.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness, if developed from this theory of cognition, is identified with self-emerged oscillatory timing and the corresponding dynamic, self-organized neural patterns (neural syntax). The brain fundamentally creates, not processes, information.",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism / Materialism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "The mind (cognition/consciousness) is related to the body as self-caused functions arising from the extremely complex central nervous system. This functions as an identity or emergent correlation within a materialist framework.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence (Justified by classification under Materialism, which posits consciousness can be fully explained by physical states, even if arising from complex processes).",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is inferred to arise from the 'inside-out' perspective, where the brain actively projects and tests hypotheses against the world. Intentionality is tied to the brain's purpose as a foretelling device focused on generating and predicting the consequences of action.",
    "qualia_account": "Not explicitly provided. The theory primarily focuses on the mechanisms of cognition. It implies that phenomenal qualities would arise from the organization of complex neural syntax, consistent with its classification as a Neurobiological Materialist theory.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Neuronal assemblies, dynamic brain rhythms, preexisting connectivity/dynamics in cortical systems, and neural syntax.",
    "epistemic_access": "Observation and modeling of neuronal activity, specifically third-person measurement of electrical activity (oscillatory timing and rhythms) and resulting cognitive functions.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "Hierarchical organization of nested brain rhythms (oscillatory timing) and cross-frequency coupling, supporting self-organized cell assembly sequences. The structure is dynamic and metastable."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Cognition, Memory, Planning, Self-awareness (as internalized action). The theory focuses on mechanisms that can potentially explain phenomenal consciousness.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Self-emerged oscillatory timing ('rhythms of the brain') serving as the fundamental organizer of neuronal information (neural syntax). Cognition is explicitly internalized action.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Dynamic process. Cognition arises when the brain uses its intrinsic self-organized dynamics to simulate consequences (internalized action), and it is sustained by perpetual interactions among multiple network oscillators.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Cortical and hippocampal networks, particularly focusing on how large-scale brain structures and electroencephalogram (EEG) waves organize information.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Brain activity is fundamentally self-caused, driven by an imperative to test hypotheses and predict consequences of actions. The function is to restructure internal rhythms to generate cognitive maps for memory and planning, exapted from basic bodily regulation circuits.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Neural syntax organizes and segments neural information via diverse brain rhythms, including hierarchical and cross-frequency coupling. Semantics bind to these spontaneous neural patterns via matching with external inputs/action consequences.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "The brain creates information rather than absorbing it. Information flow is 'inside-out': the brain fills the world with action, and external inputs select and modify spontaneous neural patterns, giving them meaning (semantics).",
    "evolutionary_account": "Cognition (including planning and memory) is explained by the exaptation and expansion of circuits and algorithms initially serving necessary bodily functions, such as regulating metabolic and energetic processes.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "The brain is a foretelling device interacting with the environment through action and restructuring internal rhythms.",
      "Spontaneous neuron activity and self-emerged oscillatory timing are the source and organizer of cognitive abilities.",

      "Studies demonstrating memory trace consolidation during sharp wave-ripple patterns of sleep."
    ],
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The main conceptual tension is that explaining high-level cognition (like neural syntax, memory, and planning) is not equivalent to explaining phenomenal consciousness ('what consciousness actually is').",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "Does the successful explanation of complex cognition and its underlying neural mechanisms sufficiently address the 'hard problem' of phenomenal consciousness?. The theory itself must be developed into a theory of consciousness to answer this.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent. The theory fits well within Neurobiological and Computational Materialism, aligning consistently with related concepts like Brain Circuits and Cycles and Top-Down Predictive Theories."

      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "As a Materialist/Neurobiological theory, it implies that consciousness is entirely physical. If the mechanisms (neural syntax, self-caused rhythms, action-based grounding) can be implemented in non-biological systems, AI consciousness is achievable in principle."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Consciousness/cognition is explained as originating solely from the specific, highly complex dynamics of biological brain matter. Survival beyond the cessation of these material processes is precluded."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Humanistic only",
      "rationale": "The focus is on the brain as a survival and hypothesis-testing mechanism evolved for adaptive advantage. Consistent with Materialism, it provides no ultimate cosmic meaning, purpose, or value, only those created by human agency."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "Assuming consciousness is strictly realized by the neural patterns, rhythms, and cognitive maps described, a perfect duplication of this highly integrated system into a non-biological medium should preserve the original first-person mental self, making virtual immortality attainable in principle."
