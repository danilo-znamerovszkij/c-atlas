    "theory_title": "How Consciousness Becomes the Physical Universe Theory",
    "summary": "This theory posits that consciousness is the ultimate, fundamental reality from which all other phenomena, including the physical universe (matter and energy), are generated. It claims that quantum physics, particularly the observer's role in measurement, offers a conceptual bridge for how consciousness interfaces with and manifests the objective world.",

    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind (consciousness) is fundamental, and the physical world (including the body/brain) is derivative of or an appearance generated by consciousness. Consciousness generates matter/energy and interfaces with the brain.",

    "emergence_type": "",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Consciousness is understood as cosmic and individual instances are limited perspectives or expressions of this ultimate awareness. Individual consciousness is a high-speed sequential process that leads to awareness.",
    "qualia_account": "The qualitative feel of experience is inherent in fundamental consciousness, which translates complex signal patterns into frames of experience or qualia.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Consciousness (as ultimate reality), matter, and energy (all derivative aspects of consciousness).",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible via the intersection of quantum theory, biology, neuroscience, and philosophical inquiry, particularly through the study of observation.",

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Consciousness governs causation, creates energy and matter, and follows quantum principles. The observation act in quantum theory is seen as the mechanism by which consciousness manifests the physical world.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Physical reality arises from consciousness. Consciousness is characterized as a high-speed sequential process and is subject to relativity, similar to time (dilation).",
    "location_and_distribution": "Ubiquitous; consciousness is all-pervading and all-encompassing (cosmic consciousness).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness plays an active and fundamental role in constructing reality by governing causation and creating matter/energy, underpinning observed reality.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The physical world emerges from consciousness, which is inherently unified, thus solving the binding problem by appeal to a unitary conscious foundation.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Consciousness is a primordial field that generates matter and energy and follows quantum principles and wave-particle duality. The interplay of consciousness with matter and energy underpins experience.",
