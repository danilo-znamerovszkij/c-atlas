    "summary": "Informational Realism asserts that reality is fundamentally defined by the capacity of entities to exchange information, serving as the relational glue that dissolves the mind-body problem. Emergent Information Theory (EIT) proposes that consciousness arises from non-material, non-detectable informational 'values' that emerge hierarchically in biological systems, enabling top-down causation over the physical body.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as emergent, non-material information that is distinct from matter or energy, yet realized within physical systems (EIT). Informational realism grounds all of reality in the exchange of information.",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism/Materialism, heavily qualified. The theory is classified under Materialism, but EIT posits information values that are explicitly non-material and non-energy.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Emergentist; EIT bridges the mind-body gap by asserting that the non-material informational hierarchy (mind) influences the physical body through top-down causation.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Strong Emergence. EIT proposes that brain function relies on hierarchical, emergent phenomena that employ 'top-down causation' common in strongly emergent systems.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity and intentionality are attributed to the emergent, hierarchical informational structures. Informational realism suggests the mind gains direct access to fundamental properties by substituting information for perception.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are implicit in the 'remarkable properties of consciousness' that arise from the hierarchical, emergent informational phenomena. The specific qualitative feel is not mechanistically detailed.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Information is the fundamental 'relational glue' of reality. Specific ontological commitments include basic units of non-material information (values) and hierarchical informational structures within biological/technological systems.",
    "epistemic_access": "EIT's non-material information values cannot be detected by physical devices but can be deduced using the coding systems used to create them. Informational realism suggests the mind has direct access via information.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The structure of consciousness is based on hierarchical levels of organization formed by basic units of non-material information (analogous to bytes and subroutines). Reality itself is an 'informationally connected whole'."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal consciousness (implied by addressing the mind-body gap), and functional brain phenomena.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The instantiation of non-detectable, non-material information 'values' in biological systems that organize into hierarchical structures and exert top-down causation.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Dynamic process. Consciousness arises through the combination of basic informational units to form hierarchical emergent phenomena.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized in biological and technological systems capable of supporting hierarchical information emergence. Informational realism posits information as the ubiquitous defining feature of reality.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness, as non-material information, exerts top-down causation, influencing the physical body. The functional brain phenomena rely on these informational hierarchies.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved through the binding and combination of basic units of information to form hierarchical levels of organization. Informational realism holds that reality is an informationally connected whole.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is treated as non-material 'values' distinct from matter or energy, organized hierarchically, serving as the primary constituent of reality.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Not explicitly detailed. The theory implicitly relies on the evolution of biological systems capable of processing and supporting strongly emergent information.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Reality's defining feature is the capacity of entities to exchange information (Informational Realism)",

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Speculative and conceptually testable. EIT's core constituents (non-material values) are defined as being incapable of being detected by any device.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The main tension arises from the theory's classification under Materialism while relying on information components that are explicitly defined as non-material and not composed of energy, potentially straining coherence with strict physicalism.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise mechanism by which non-material informational emergence translates into phenomenal subjective experience remains unclear, given that information values are defined merely as 'values' deduced from states.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Internally consistent as a theory of strong emergence and top-down causation based on layered information. Its coherence with physicalism is strained by the assertion of non-material, non-energy informational components."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "As a computational and informational theory classified under Materialism, it implies that consciousness is achievable if artificial systems can instantiate the necessary complex, hierarchical, and strongly emergent informational structures."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "The theory is classified under Materialism, which generally holds that consciousness is wholly dependent on the physical substrate (brain), meaning that the destruction of the body results in the cessation of the conscious self. The non-material nature of the information values is dependent on the physical states of the system."
    },
    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is fundamentally an informational structure (even if the information is non-material), duplicating this structure and its dynamics (including the capacity for hierarchical emergence and top-down causation) into a non-biological medium should allow for the continuation of the first-person mental self."
    },
    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Humanistic only",
      "rationale": "Located within the Materialism category, the theory supports a science-based perspective that typically entails humanistic meaning and purpose created by individuals, rather than cosmic or ultimate teleology."
