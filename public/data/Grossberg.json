    "summary": "Grossberg’s theory establishes that all conscious states are resonant states arising from the interaction of bottom-up sensory patterns with learned top-down expectations. This theoretical foundation, Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART), explains how the brain self-organizes to consciously attend, categorize, recognize, and predict phenomena in a dynamic world. It claims the varieties of these brain resonances make progress toward solving the hard problem of consciousness.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as a persistent resonant state resulting from the interaction between bottom-up patterns and learned top-down expectations, capable of supporting conscious awareness when it includes feature-selective cells representing qualia. The mind is conceptualized as an activity, or a verb, not a static entity.",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Identity/Monistic. Mind is the activity (a verb, not a noun) of the physical brain, regulated by mechanistically similar laws conserved across cellular systems.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence. Based on its classification as a Materialism Theory relying on computational structures and conserved biological laws, consciousness is expected to be fully explicable by, though perhaps not intuitively reducible to, lower-level processes.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Intentionality (recognition, prediction, learning) is regulated by attentive consciousness, which is realized in the resonant state. Subjectivity is accounted for by the inclusion of feature-selective cells that represent qualia within these states.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are identified as feature-selective cells included within the persistent resonant state, supporting conscious awareness. Grossberg suggests this helps address the hard problem of consciousness.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Resonant states, computational structures, bottom-up sensory patterns, top-down expectations, and conserved laws of short-term and long-term memory/activation across biological systems.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible via neural and cognitive modeling, observation of brain data, and analysis of how humans consciously perceive and know things.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "A resonant state established through the continuous interaction of bottom-up sensory inputs and top-down learned expectations, regulated by common laws of short-term and long-term memory."

    "causation_and_functional_role": "Attentive consciousness regulates actions that interact with cognitive processes like learning, recognition, and prediction. It provides the ability to autonomously learn and categorize objects and events in a changing world."

      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "If the mind is functionally defined as a system of computational activities (resonant states), then a sufficiently complete reproduction of this structure in a non-biological medium should, in principle, preserve the first-person mental self."
