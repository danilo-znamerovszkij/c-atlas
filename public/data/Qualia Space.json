    "summary": "This theory posits that consciousness is an independent, non-reducible feature of reality existing alongside fundamental physical laws, such as the four forces, spacetime, and mass-energy . This feature is conceived as a radically new structure or organization, potentially existing as a different dimension of reality .",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as an independent, non-reducible feature of reality, structured as a radically new organization or dimension called 'qualia-space' .",
    "ontological_status": "Non-Reducible Fundamental Feature (Justification: Defined as independent and non-reducible, existing 'in addition to' fundamental physics, placing it in an expanded ontology framework like Panpsychism, where it is classified ).",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Requires a correlation or interaction where the physical brain accesses or manifests this non-reducible feature existing alongside physical reality . (Specific details depend on the instantiation of the theory).",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive",
    "emergence_type": "Not applicable (Defined as a fundamental/non-reducible feature ).",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is inherent to the existence of the Qualia Space structure itself. Intentionality is mapped onto specific organizational properties within this structure, corresponding to conscious percepts .",

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a structural or dimensional reality that is manifested locally by physical systems (like brains) .",
    "location_and_distribution": "The Qualia Space itself is an independent, non-reducible dimension of reality . Conscious experience (e.g., in humans) is the localized manifestation or 'unfolding' of structure within this space .",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "If defined as an intrinsic entity or true existence (as in related IIT concepts), the consciousness structure possesses cause-effect power . Functionally, it accounts for the existence of phenomenal experience/qualia .",
    "integration_or_binding": "Achieved inherently by the unity and maximal irreducibility of the structure itself that constitutes the Qualia Space .",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Consciousness is defined by the structure of information or representation contained within the conceptual structures of the Qualia Space .",
    "evolutionary_account": "The Qualia Space feature is fundamental ; the physical systems capable of accessing or embodying this structure must evolve to a sufficient complexity (Justification: Consistent with Panpsychism's general stance on the manifestation of consciousness ).",

    "testability_status": "Speculative and conceptually testable (Justification: Postulates a radically new, unknown structure/dimension, making direct empirical testing difficult, though theories related to its conceptual structure claim testability) .",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "Reliance on mathematical modeling and phenomenological correlation (e.g., defining the structure/geometry of experience) (Justification: Drawing on related theories like IIT or QRI which utilize this conceptual structure) .",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Criticized for requiring an expansion of reality beyond what is currently known in physics, leading to theories that may 'elude scientific description' . The necessary necessity of postulating a new dimension is questioned .",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise nature and causal mechanisms of the consciousness-causing feature are unknown . It is unclear whether this feature is ubiquitous (classic panpsychism) or localized (as suggested by its clearest exemplar, IIT) .",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent in expanding ontology to accommodate non-reducible consciousness, aligning with Panpsychism's high-level goal, but contrasts sharply with reductive physicalism ."
