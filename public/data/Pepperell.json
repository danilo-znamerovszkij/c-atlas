    "theory_title": "Pepperell’s Organization of Energy",
    "summary": "This theory proposes that consciousness is a specific product resulting from the organization of energetic activity within the brain, rather than purely information processing. Consciousness arises because there is something experienced intrinsically by the system undergoing this unique organization of 'actualized differences of motion and tension.'",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as the intrinsic experience resulting from a specific, dynamic organization of energetic activity in the brain, described as 'actualized differences of motion and tension'.",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Identity Theory (Energy Organization variant). Consciousness is a physical process achieved by the brain's unique organization of energy, making it inseparable from the physical substrate.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence. It is inferred as a potentially explainable physical product, aiming to naturalize consciousness as a specific physical process rather than positing new fundamental laws.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity arises from the fact that there is 'something it is like, intrinsically' for the system to undergo this specific energy organization. Intentionality is presumably handled as a function of the resulting energy dynamics serving the 'interests of the organism'.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia (qualitative feel) are explained as the intrinsically experienced qualities derived directly from undergoing a certain organization of actualized energy differences in the brain.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Energetic activity, forces, work ('actualized differences of motion and tension'), and organizational patterns within the neural substrate.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible by studying and modeling the organization of energetic processes, possibly using information-theoretic techniques as a 'map' for the 'territory' of energy.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic constituents are energetic activity (forces and motion/tension differences) organized via 'dynamic recursive organization' and 'appropriate reentrant intracortical activity'."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal (intrinsic experience), Agency, and general survival/adaptive functionality.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Consciousness arises uniquely from the specific *organization* of energy processing in the brain, differentiated from energy dynamics in non-conscious systems.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic process arising from the complex and changing organization of energetic activity.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Located in the brain, arising from the organization of energetic activity within the neural substrate.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness plays a functional role in surviving, as the brain acts as a 'difference engine' that serves the 'interests of the organism' by processing energy differences efficiently.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved through the overall 'organization' (complexity and degree of differentiation/integration) of energetic activity, potentially mediated by reentrant intracortical activity.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is understood as a measure of how energetic activity is organized (its complexity or differentiation/integration). Information processing models are tools to map this energy processing.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness has an adaptive, evolutionary role in that the brain's energy organization efficiently actuates differences of motion and tension required to serve the organism's interests.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Consciousness is a specific product of the organization of energetic activity in the brain.",
      "The brain's governing principle is energy processing, not merely information processing.",
      "Intrinsic experience results from the unique organization of 'actualized differences of motion and tension'.",
      "The model faces the challenge of explaining why energetic organization in the brain yields consciousness but in other organs (like the liver) does not."

    "testability_status": "Empirically testable (in principle)",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "None explicitly detailed, but testability is centered on measuring and differentiating the 'organization of energetic activity' between conscious brain regions/states and non-conscious organs/states.",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The theory is challenged to definitively specify the unique organizational traits of energy in the brain that correlate with consciousness, distinguishing it from energy use in other high-energy, non-conscious organs (like the heart or liver).",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The critical limitation is identifying the necessary and sufficient conditions for energetic organization in the brain to produce consciousness, which is currently unproven.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent within a broader Materialist/Physicalist framework, specifically a subset focusing on energy rather than pure computation/information as the fundamental physical feature."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Conditional",
      "rationale": "Possible, as consciousness is functionally defined by the organization of energy dynamics; perfect duplication of this intricate pattern in a synthetic medium should theoretically preserve subjective experience, provided the replication technology is sufficient."
