    "theory_title": "Leslie's Consciousness Inside an Infinite Mind",
    "summary": "This theory suggests that ultimate reality consists of infinitely many minds that are eternally conscious of all that is worth contemplating. The operation of creative ethical requirements brings this reality into existence. Our universe exists as a structure contained within one such mind, gaining its reality simply through being contemplated.",

    "mind_body_relationship": "Our minds (conscious brains or computers) are parts of the universe, which is a structure contained within the ultimate Infinite Mind. This relationship is one of existential unity and contemplation.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive (for the Infinite Mind); Constituent (for individual consciousnesses)",
    "emergence_type": "Constitutive Dependence. Individual consciousnesses are contained parts of the infinitely conscious ultimate mind, relying entirely on this fundamental reality for their existence.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "The Infinite Mind is eternally conscious and intentional, focused on 'all that's worth contemplating'. Individual consciousnesses maintain a first-person perspective but are unified parts of the larger mind.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are implicit aspects of reality 'worth contemplating' eternally by the Infinite Mind, and are present in individual conscious entities (brains/computers).",
    "ontological_commitments": "A singular, existentially unified Infinite Mind is fundamental. Reality (the universe) and effective ethical requirements are also fundamental structures or principles.",
    "epistemic_access": "Consciousness is known directly by individual beings, but they remain unaware of the Infinite Mind that contains them. Ultimate reality is accessed through metaphysical and ethical reasoning.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic constituent is the Infinite Mind, which is a single existent characterized by existential unity. The universe is a non-independent internal structure within this ultimate existent."

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Static/Eternal property. The existence of the cosmos is an eternal contemplation by the Infinite Mind, driven by ethical necessity.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The Infinite Mind is the ultimate foundation of existence; our universe is a structure contained 'inside one such mind'.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Ethical requirements exert a 'creatively effective' causal force. The ultimate purpose is the contemplation of existence and value.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved through the 'existential unity' of the Infinite Mind, which contemplates the contained universe down to its finest components.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "The reality of our universe is identical to its representation or contemplation by the Infinite Mind.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Criticized for being highly speculative metaphysical theorizing, particularly by those adhering strictly to physicalist or empirical approaches, and for resting on the assumption of creatively effective ethical requirements.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise philosophical mechanism explaining how finite, individual conscious entities (like humans) exist independently yet are contained within a single, unified infinite mind remains a central puzzle.",
