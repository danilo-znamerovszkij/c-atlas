    "summary": "This category collects the diverse concepts of the soul found across indigenous and folk religions globally. These beliefs typically involve multifarious, non-physical soul components, some of which are thought to disappear at death while others persevere, reflecting aspects of traditional dualism.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness, or the 'self', is identified as originating from or consisting of one or more spiritual or non-physical soul substances, distinct from the physical body.",
    "ontological_status": "Traditional Dualism/Poly-aspect Spiritualism. These systems posit multiple distinct, fundamental categories of existence (spiritual/soul and material/body).",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Complex, often partial, dualistic interaction/correlation. The soul component informs or animates the body, but certain soul components may survive or pre-exist the physical body, indicating independence.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive",
    "emergence_type": "N/A. Since the soul is often described as pre-existing or derived from a creator, it is considered a fundamental entity rather than emerging from material processes.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity and intentionality are inherent to the non-physical soul entity itself, which is often believed to choose destiny (e.g., Ewe tradition) or define personhood.",
    "qualia_account": "Not explicitly defined. The focus is on the existence and persistence of the soul entity, implying that qualitative experience is an inherent property of the spiritual component.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical body and multiple non-physical soul substances (e.g., different types of soul, breath of life, disincarnated spirits).",
    "epistemic_access": "Knowledge is accessed through religious tradition, cultural knowledge, personal belief, and spiritual or transformative experience, rather than systematic third-person scientific observation.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The conscious structure is comprised of multifarious soul types (e.g., seven types recognized by the Fang of Gabon), often with hierarchical or functional distinctions regarding their fate upon death."
  },
  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Survival beyond death, personal identity, spiritual existence, and destiny.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Spiritual origination (soul derived from a creator) and acquisition through specific physical or ritualistic actions (e.g., combat, pilgrimage) are key principles related to the creation or augmentation of the soul.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Spiritual origination. The soul is often described as existing from or before incarnation, originating from an almighty spirit or supreme creator.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The location is individual/personal, though sometimes tied to physical attributes (like the breath or blood). The belief systems themselves are geographically ubiquitous.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The soul determines or selects the individual's destiny and is the component that survives bodily death.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Implicit. While multiple soul types may exist within one individual, the mechanism by which they bind into a single unified experience is not detailed, but they collectively define the person.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Not explicitly discussed. These concepts predate modern theories of information processing as explanatory factors for consciousness.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Not applicable/Spiritual origination replaces biological evolution. The soul is often derived from an ultimate source, contrasting with natural phylogenetic evolution.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Soul beliefs are widespread, persistent anthropological data that consciousness studies should acknowledge.",
      "The human person consists of multiple distinct soul components, suggesting a complex configuration of identity.",
      "Certain parts of the soul persevere after physical death, allowing for post-mortem survival."
    ],
    "basis_of_belief_or_evidence_type": "Anthropological data, religious tradition, cultural history."

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Speculative/Anthropological. As ancient belief systems, these concepts are not subject to modern scientific methods of experimentation or falsification.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Often categorized as 'pre-modern' or 'pre-scientific' by mainstream researchers due to lacking philosophical sophistication or empirical grounding. No claims are made that these beliefs rigorously corroborate modern philosophical dualism.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The relationship between the various soul aspects and phenomenal consciousness is loosely defined. The model does not offer a causal mechanism compatible with contemporary physics to explain interaction.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Internally coherent within specific cultural frameworks but fundamentally inconsistent with physicalist and materialist ontological frameworks due to the reliance on non-physical substances."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Consciousness requires a spiritual component (soul/spirit) derived from non-physical sources or a creator, which artificial systems would intrinsically lack."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "Post-mortem survival is a central feature, as several components of the soul are posited to persevere after the death of the biological body."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Cosmic/Existential",
      "rationale": "The belief systems entail ultimate meaning by positing pre-existence, spiritual origination from a creator, and an overarching structure governing individual destiny."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Immortality is achieved through the persistence of the original spiritual soul, and cannot be obtained via technological duplication or simulation of the physical body's functional patterns."
