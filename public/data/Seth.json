    "summary": "This theory posits that conscious experiences, including perceptions of the world and the self, are forms of brain-based perceptual prediction, metaphorically termed 'controlled hallucinations' . It roots the mechanism of consciousness in the fundamental biological imperative to regulate bodily physiology in order to stay alive .",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as forms of brain-based perceptual prediction, where phenomenological properties are explained by the computational aspects of different forms of prediction .",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism / Materialism (Justified by its classification under Materialism Theories and its reliance on biological and computational explanations) .",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Conscious experiences are entirely brain-based and physically instantiated . The model supports a strong correlation or identity theory, where conscious properties arise from the physiological and computational architecture geared toward bodily regulation .",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence (Justified: The theory is a materialist account proposing that subjective experience arises from complex, computational brain processes . These processes are assumed to be explainable, in principle, by underlying physical laws, characteristic of weak emergence.)",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity arises because perception is determined by the content of top-down predictions, resulting in a phenomenal experience that is an 'inside-out neuronal fantasy' constrained by reality . The theory accounts for self-experience by explaining differences between experiences of the world and experiences of the self .",

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic process where experience arises from ongoing prediction; it is akin to a 'waking dream' constantly reined in by reality .",
    "location_and_distribution": "Located in the biological brain, tied to the predictive machinery that regulates bodily physiology .",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness has a functional role tied to survival . It facilitates the regulation of bodily physiology and allows the organism to model, predict, and simulate the causes of sensory inputs .",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved through the formation of a coherent perceptual world—the 'controlled hallucination'—which unifies ambiguous sensory signals via top-down predictions .",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Conscious perception is determined by the content of top-down predictions rather than the bottom-up sensory signals themselves. Sensory signals are interpreted as representations of external causes .",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Not explicitly detailed in the source, but generally subject to the tension inherent in deflationary accounts of consciousness .",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "Like many theories of consciousness, it faces the general challenge that as empirical data accumulates, theories seem to proliferate rather than being definitively ruled out .",
