    "summary": "Gibson proposes an embodied, situated, and non-representational approach to perception, arguing that information is directly available in the environment (invariants) and is perceived in terms of affordances. This approach offers a third way beyond cognitivism and behaviorism, and can be cautiously inferred as an explanation for consciousness.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is understood by extension as a function of the continuous interaction and informational flow within the organism-environment system, characterized by direct perception of invariants and affordances, rather than internal mental representations.",
    "ontological_status": "Physicalism/Direct Realism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind/perception is continuous with action, focusing on the organism-environment system as the unit of analysis, rejecting the idea that mind is solely reducible to processes inside the head.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is constituted by the dynamic, situated relationship of the organism to the environment (organism-environment system). Intentionality (directedness of thought) is explained by the perception of affordances, which are action possibilities inherent in the environment.",
    "qualia_account": "The theory is non-representational and is generally aligned with views that reject internal sense data (qualia) as traditionally conceived, favoring direct perception of environmental properties (invariants and affordances).",
    "ontological_commitments": "Organism-environment system, optical information (invariants), affordances.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessible through studying the relationship between the organism and its socio-physical environment, rather than introspection focused on internal states.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The structure of consciousness/perception is based on the functional relationship between the organism and the environment, emphasizing the continuity of perception and action."

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Direct perception of environmental invariants (unchanging elements in the optical flow) and affordances (action opportunities provided by the environment).",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "The focus is on dynamic flow and continuity within the organism-environment system, rather than emergence from discrete, localized neural structures.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Situated within the organism-environment system, extending beyond the brain and inside the head.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Perception functions to guide adaptive behavior and enhances fitness by detecting invariants and opportunities for action (affordances).",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is inherent in the direct and unified apprehension of the organism-environment system as a single unit of analysis.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Rejects information processing models; information is external (invariants) and directly accessed by the perceptual systems without the need for internal construction of representations.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The emphasis on affordances suggests that this perceptual system evolved because it provided obvious survival value and enhanced fitness.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Perception is directly related to the stimulus alone, requiring neither inference nor internal mental representations.",
      "The primary objects of perception are affordances, not particular sensory qualities.",
      "The unit of analysis for understanding perception is the organism-environment system.",
      "The theory rejects the premise of the poverty of the stimulus common in cognitivist models."

    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "Empirical observation of perception and detailed analysis of organism-environment interaction fields.",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The theory critiques mainstream theories of perception, specifically attacking both behaviorism and cognitivism/information processing. Its extension to phenomenal consciousness is speculative and subject to skepticism from those committed to internal representation theories.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The core theory addresses perception and cognition; the application or extension to explaining phenomenal consciousness (the 'what-it-is-like' aspect) requires cautious inference.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within its ecological and situated anti-reductionist materialist ontology, but fundamentally conflicts with theories reliant on cognitive symbol manipulation."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Possible",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is a product of direct, situated interaction within an organism-environment system (as implied by this Materialism theory), then AI could achieve consciousness if engineered to embody and interact within a physical environment capable of perceiving affordances."
    },
    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "The theory is classified under Materialism, focusing on the living, biological organism and its physical environment. There is no posited non-physical component that could survive bodily death."
    },
    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Humanistic/Adaptive",
      "rationale": "The primary functional role of perception is adaptive behavior through the detection of affordances, consistent with a Materialist view where meaning is created by humans in their environment for survival and flourishing."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Conditional",
      "rationale": "As consciousness is tied to the physical organism-environment unit, virtual immortality would be attainable only if the essential embodied, non-representational interactions could be perfectly captured and simulated in a new physical medium."
