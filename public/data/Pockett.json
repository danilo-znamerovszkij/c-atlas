    "summary": "This electromagnetic field theory posits that conscious experiences are identical to specific electromagnetic patterns generated by the brain. It emphasizes that consciousness is a physical thing—a spatial electromagnetic pattern—and not a neural process, necessitating a definition for the specific three-dimensional shape of conscious patterns.",

    "mind_body_relationship": "Identity theory. Conscious experiences are literally identical with certain electromagnetic patterns.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence. Consciousness arises from ongoing unconscious processing, implying that its properties are reducible in principle to underlying physics/electromagnetism, although this is implicit rather than explicitly stated as weak emergence in the source material.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Not explicitly detailed, as the focus is on the objective physical nature (3D shape) of the conscious pattern, rather than the subjective process of feeling or intentionality.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia correspond to the specific qualitative characteristics determined by the unique 3D shape of the conscious electromagnetic patterns.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical electromagnetic fields (EM), neural wetware, and distinct 3D geometric patterns in the EM field.",

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The defining characteristic of consciousness is the existence of a specific 3D shape or characteristic within the brain's electromagnetic field (EM patterns), differentiating it from all non-conscious EM activity.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Dynamic process/state. Consciousness is generated by ongoing unconscious processing (a process) but exists as a resultant static pattern (a thing) at any given moment.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized as specific spatial electromagnetic patterns generated at certain times and places in the mammalian brain.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Not explicitly detailed. The role is positional and identificational (consciousness *is* the pattern), though implicitly tied to brain function, and rejects the notion of consciousness as a primary process (like focal attention).",
    "integration_or_binding": "Not explicitly addressed, but implicitly solved by identifying consciousness with a single unified EM pattern.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information processing in the brain is unconscious. Consciousness is the resulting electromagnetic pattern generated by this unconscious processing.",

      "Conscious experiences are identical with specific electromagnetic patterns generated by the brain",
      "Consciousness is a thing (spatial EM pattern), not a process",

    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "The underlying premise is a testable hypothesis about specifying the 3D characteristics distinguishing conscious vs. non-conscious electromagnetic fields.",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The theory fundamentally contradicts the prevailing view in cognitive psychology that consciousness is a process (functionalist dogma). The primary challenge is rigorously defining the specific 3D spatial characteristics that constitute a conscious pattern.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise 3D shape or pattern that characterizes conscious electromagnetic fields remains unspecified, leaving the necessary and sufficient conditions for consciousness unclear.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within an extended physicalist framework, defining consciousness in terms of a physical substrate (EM field) that is already a product of neural activity."
