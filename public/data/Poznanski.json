    "summary": "This is a quantum biological theory, rooted in Type-B materialism, which models consciousness using a multiscalar temporal-topological framework. Consciousness is claimed to arise spontaneously when the functionality of multiscale complexity in a living negentropic state of the brain exceeds the functionality derived from maximum complexity.",

    "ontological_status": "Type-B Materialism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness is a physical process, but epistemically objective knowledge alone does not define physicalism. The theory employs self-referential dynamical pathways to establish consciousness within the material brain.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Strong Emergence (Inferred)",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity is approached epistemically, where physical properties are assessed subjectively via quantum biological effects. Intentionality is the output of the spontaneous process, serving as an instruction to act in path selection, giving rise to a sense of self through self-reference.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are avoided in discussion as they do not apply to conscious reality under functional-structural realism, appearing instead as a black box of 'being.' However, the theory implies unique functional interactions are not phenomenally equivalent in other systems.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Multiscale complexity (functional and structural), living negentropic state of the brain, and quantum potential energy (implicitly, as the source of additional degrees of freedom).",
    "epistemic_access": "Consciousness is accessed through an epistemically subjective approach to dynamic organicity, focusing on the act of understanding uncertainty rather than relying on introspection or memory recall.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "A nonspatial topological framework characterized by holarchical modularity, focusing on the temporal aspect of functionality and self-referential dynamic pathways spanning microscale to macroscale."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Sentience, Intentionality, Sense of Self",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Consciousness arises when $F_{MultiComplexity} > F_{MaxComplexity}$. This required functionality increase is provided by an additional degree of freedom made possible by quantum biological effects imposed by the brain's living negentropic state.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic state of being organic, not a static property. It is not a step-function but a gradual ascendance to plateaus, and appears spontaneously from irreducible quantum-thermal fluctuations.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Located in the material brain's functional dynamics. Distributed via self-referential dynamical pathways that span from microscale to macroscale, including nonlocal pathways.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness's functionality imposes thermodynamic constraints on macroscopic systems. Its output (intentionality) provides instruction to act in path selection. Self-reference replaces emergence/self-organization in dealing with functionality, enabling diachronic causation and weak unity.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Achieved through the uniqueness of self-referential dynamical pathways which create a weak unity of consciousness via its temporal structure.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Consciousness allows intrinsic information to be structured within the negentropic state of the brain, leveraging an additional degree of freedom.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The theory is consistent with evolutionary development, assuming that the required functional multiscale complexity evolved to satisfy the necessary condition for consciousness.",
