    "theory_title": "Teilhard de Cardin’s Evolving Consciousness",
    "summary": "This theory frames consciousness axially within a grand cosmic system defined by continuing complexification. It posits that consciousness and matter are complementary aspects of the same cosmic substance, leading toward a unified convergence and a hyper-personalized organism, referred to as Omega.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is identified as the 'withinness' or 'radial energy' of matter, complementing its 'withoutness' or 'tangential energy' (physical attraction), existing as two inseparable aspects of the same cosmic stuff.",
    "ontological_status": "Dual-Aspect Monism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Mind and matter are complementary aspects of a single cosmic stuff; neither is reducible to the other, yet they cannot function without each other.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "Law-like emergence linked to increasing complexification, as the exterior physical complexity drives a corresponding rise in interior levels of consciousness (the law of complexity-consciousness).",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity (withinness) is a primitive component of matter that rises in intensity with complexity. The cosmos possesses inherent purpose and direction, converging toward the goal-directed Omega.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia, or the subjective feel, are accounted for by the interior aspect ('withinness' or radial energy) of matter, ensuring that subjective experience rises proportionally with the complexity of the physical structure.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Cosmic stuff (with dual aspects of matter/consciousness), the noosphere (layer of mind/thought/spirit), and Omega (God) as the ultimate unifying power.",
    "epistemic_access": "The theory draws on the philosophical necessity of a constitutive interior aspect of reality (phenomenological view) and the observation of cosmological and biological evolution (third-person modeling) that exhibits increasing complexity and convergence.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The basic constituent is a single 'cosmic stuff' with complementary aspects (radial and tangential energy). Consciousness is structured by a developmental process of convergence and complexification."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Self-awareness, Purpose/Meaning, Cosmology, Agency (human co-creator role).",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The law of complexity-consciousness, which dictates that the greater the exterior physical complexity, the greater the interior level of consciousness, driving evolutionary progress.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic, continuous process of evolution and complexification, moving toward a state of 'hyper-personalized organism' and unified convergence.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Ubiquitous, existing as the 'withinness' of matter from the Big Bang onward. It is 'planetized' within the noosphere and culminates in the human person as self-reflective consciousness.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness (radial energy, identified as love) is the fundamental energy driving evolution toward 'more being and consciousness.' Human consciousness is self-reflective, enabling the person to act as a co-creator in the universe's completion.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Unification and integration occur through the evolutionary process of 'unified convergence,' driven by the core energy of the universe, which is love.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "The emergence of high complexity, exemplified by computers, evokes a 'new level of shared consciousness' and a 'field of global mind' via interconnecting pathways.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness is axial in cosmic evolution; evolution is fundamentally the rise of consciousness culminating in self-reflective consciousness in humans, with the ultimate goal being convergence toward Omega.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Evolution is fundamentally the rise of consciousness, following the law of complexity-consciousness.",
      "Matter possesses an inner aspect ('withinness' or radial energy) which rises with physical complexity.",
      "The process converges toward Omega (God), the unifying power in evolution."

    "testability_status": "Speculative",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "As a comprehensive metaphysical framework, it may be criticized by materialists for relying on theological concepts and for postulating non-physical aspects ('withinness' or 'radial energy') that lack empirical access or falsification.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise mechanism by which increasing complexity generates a corresponding rise in consciousness remains metaphysical, and the definition of Omega (God) as an emergent goal introduces non-empirical factors.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within its own expansive monistic and evolutionary framework, successfully integrating mind and matter into a single process of becoming."

      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "If the law of complexity-consciousness holds universally, artificial systems achieving sufficient complexity and interconnectedness (like the 'field of global mind' evoked by computers) would necessarily experience consciousness."
