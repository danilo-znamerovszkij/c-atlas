This mechanism, based on the law of synchronization, enables neurons to form a rigid network essential for intelligent life.",

    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness arises dynamically as remote neurons 'learn' from each other, adjust their pace, and eventually lock their phases to form a focused, synchronized network structure.",
    "location_and_distribution": "The mechanism is distributed across remote, parallel-arranged cells in the cortex (e.g., cell-cell distance greater than 10 mm).",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The mechanism is necessary for complex functions, providing the 'super-highway' required for human intelligence that traditional synaptic networks cannot provide alone.",

    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information flows rapidly (light speed) through the electrical field network, enabling rapid communication across the cortex beyond traditional synaptic limitations.",

    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The specific manner in which synchronization and electrical field activity translate into rich, private phenomenal experience (qualia) is not detailed in the sources, posing a classic explanatory gap challenge common to many materialist theories (Source Limitation Inference).",
