    "theory_title": "Loorits's Structural Realism",
    "summary": "This theory posits that conscious experiences are fully structural phenomena residing in the brain as complex higher-order patterns in neural activity. It solves the hard problem by arguing that qualia, though appearing qualitative and non-structural, are actually complex compositional structures mistakenly perceived as monadic properties by the neural pattern itself.",

    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity arises because the complex neural pattern misperceives its own highly complex structural properties as simple, monadic qualities. Conscious experiences are understood as objective structures existing in the world.",

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The mechanism is the generation of a complex neural pattern that misperceives its own structural complexity as monadic and qualitative, thereby creating the subjective 'seeming' of non-structural qualia.",

      "The prediction that proper brain-stimulating technology should reveal the structural nature of qualia directly to the experiencing subject."

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Loorits noted an internal tension: while qualia may be relational 'behind the scenes,' they still elude scientific description as long as they subjectively feel intrinsic, meaning the hard problem persists in a sense.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The limitation is accounting for the phenomenal persistence of the intrinsic feeling of qualia when the subject is unaware of their underlying structural/relational components.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Highly coherent within a physicalist framework committed to structural realism, reducing phenomenal properties to structural facts about the brain. It aligns modestly with illusionism by explaining 'non-structural seemings' as perspectival."

      "stance": "Yes (Likely)",
      "rationale": "Since consciousness is identified entirely with structural physical properties (neural patterns), duplicating these patterns in a non-biological medium should result in a perfect continuation of the conscious self, consistent with Materialism/Functionalism principles."
