    "theory_title": "Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)",
    "summary": "Adaptive Resonance Theory is a cognitive and neural framework detailing how the brain autonomously learns to consciously attend, categorize, recognise, and predict events in a dynamic environment. Its central claim is that all conscious states are resonant states that emerge from the sustained interaction between bottom-up sensory patterns and learned top-down expectations.",

    "mind_body_relationship": "The mind (conscious activity) arises from mechanistic links and physical processes in the brain, specifically the resonant states regulated by brain design principles (Identity/Reductive in nature due to classification under Materialism).",

    "emergence_type": "Weak Emergence",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Consciousness enables critical functions like learning, expectation, and attention. Intentionality is achieved through the brainâ€™s autonomous ability to consciously attend, categorize, and predict objects and events.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia are represented by feature-selective cells that are incorporated into the persistent resonant state. The varieties of brain resonances and the conscious experiences they support are claimed to make progress towards solving the hard problem.",

    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is causally active, enabling learning, expectation, attention, resonance, and synchrony. It marks perceptual and cognitive representations that are stable enough to control effective actions (survival advantage).",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is achieved through the resonant state itself, which imposes correlations on diverse, interacting neural groups, unifying information from bottom-up sensory input and top-down knowledge.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information flows bidirectionally, stabilized by complementary computing and hierarchical resolution of uncertainty. Conscious representations must be complete and context-sensitive to control actions.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness evolved because it is required for generating stable, context-sensitive perceptual and cognitive representations necessary to control effective actions in a changing world. It is rooted in conserved self-organizing biological laws.",
