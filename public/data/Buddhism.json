    "theory_title": "Buddhism’s Empty, Illusory Phenomenal Consciousness",
    "summary": "This theory suggests that the sense of phenomenal consciousness or 'what-it-is-like-ness' is an instance of cognitive illusion, rejecting the existence of a permanent, inner 'self' or 'soul'. It posits that consciousness, like all phenomena, is ultimately empty of intrinsic nature, and is better understood as a network of relational processes.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness (in the phenomenal sense) is identified as a cognitive illusion or conventional reality constituted by a network of processes/relations (Madhyamaka) or as an inner subjective substrate of representations (Yogācāra).",
    "ontological_status": "Idealism (specifically the Yogācāra school) or Deflationary Relationalism (specifically the Madhyamaka school), where all things are conventionally real but ultimately empty of intrinsic nature.",
    "mind_body_relationship": "The relationship is understood as interdependent and relational, lacking intrinsic self/substance. The illusion of a centralized mind or self is rejected.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Conventional reality constituted by relations. It is neither a primitive substance nor an emergent property in the typical Western sense, as the phenomenal self it describes is fundamentally illusory.",
    "emergence_type": "The subjective sense of self is rejected as an illusion, thus strong or weak emergence concepts are bypassed. Consciousness exists as conventionally real, arising from interdependent processes.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "The sense of subjectivity ('for-me-ness') is a pernicious cognitive illusion created by the seventh consciousness, but ultimately dissolves upon realization of the non-self (anatta) doctrine.",
    "qualia_account": "Qualia ('what-it-is-like-ness') are rejected as real, intrinsic properties and are instead viewed as illusory, dissolving away in favor of a network of underlying processes.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Commitment to conventional reality and interdependent phenomena, while rejecting the existence of irreducible phenomenal properties, internal representations (Madhyamaka), and a permanent self. The eighth consciousness (store-house) is also posited.",
    "epistemic_access": "Through philosophical argument, analysis of conscious processes, and disciplined introspective methods, especially meditative techniques (which can lead to a reduction of brain synchronization).",
    "constituents_and_structure": "A network of processes analyzed through the scheme of the nine kinds/levels of consciousness: five senses, mind consciousness (integrates senses), inward consciousness (creates self-concept), store-house consciousness (persists, carries karma), and Buddha nature (purest foundation)."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal consciousness (to deny it), Access, Self-awareness (to deny the self), and the different levels of sensory and cognitive awareness.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle of emptiness (lack of intrinsic nature) applied to all phenomena, resulting in the realization that phenomenal consciousness is a cognitive illusion.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness arises from the interdependence of processes. The experience of self emerges serially from awareness and 'awareness of awareness', though this self is illusory.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Non-localized. Consciousness is often understood relationally. The ninth consciousness (Buddha nature) is the fundamental, purest core.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "The inward-directed seventh consciousness causes the concept of self, which is the source of deception. The eighth consciousness stores karmic energy and persists across death, thus enabling rebirth.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The sixth consciousness, or mind consciousness, functions to integrate the five senses and provide meaning.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Information is processed through the various levels of consciousness (nine kinds). The deflationary view rejects internal representations/qualia, favoring only the network of processes involved in perception.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness is understood within the context of Indian philosophical traditions concerning soul/spirit, which typically involve reincarnation through countless cycles of birth, death, and rebirth. This suggests a non-biological basis for consciousness persistence (the eighth consciousness).",

  "empirics_and_critiques": {
    "testability_status": "Largely conceptual, based on internal philosophical coherence and phenomenological insights gained via meditative practices. Empirical studies sometimes correlate high-level meditation states (nirodha-samāpatti) with measurable brain changes (reduced synchronization).",

      "Study of high meditative states (nirodha-samāpatti) showing reduced overall brain synchronization."

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Western philosophers often find the core claim—that phenomenal consciousness is illusory—counter-intuitive and untenable. Internally, tension exists between the idealistic Yogācāra school and the relational Madhyamaka school.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "If Madhyamaka is accepted (consciousness is empty), the problem shifts from defining consciousness to explaining how awareness itself arises. If the illusion claim is held, its proponents must continually defend against the intuitive reality of subjective experience.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Coherent within its own foundational metaphysical doctrines, such as the Two Truths (ultimate emptiness and conventional reality). Fits decently into the Idealism category, although Madhyamaka challenges the substantiality typical of Idealism."

    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Uncertain",
      "rationale": "If consciousness is fundamentally an illusion arising from a network of processes, it is unclear whether advanced computation (AI) can replicate the complex conventional reality or the specific non-self processes that generate this illusion, even though computation is not fundamentally ruled out."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes (Blurred/Non-Personal)",
      "rationale": "The eighth (store-house) consciousness persists after death, carrying karmic energy through cycles of reincarnation. However, survival often entails expansion back into cosmic consciousness, blurring or banishing individual first-person identity ('being sugar')."

    "meaning_and_purpose": {
      "stance": "Cosmic/Spiritual",
      "rationale": "The ultimate goal is spiritual attainment (reaching the ninth consciousness or Buddha nature), which serves as the core source of energy and ultimate fulfillment, moving beyond merely humanistic purpose."

    "virtual_immortality": {
      "stance": "Not Needed",
      "rationale": "The theory already provides a mechanism for persistence (the eighth consciousness) or transcendence (ninth consciousness), making artificial, digital duplication (virtual immortality) philosophically moot."
