    "theory_title": "Blockâ€™s Biological Reductionism",
    "summary": "Block advocates for a reductive physicalist account of phenomenal consciousness, distinguishing it sharply from cognitive access. He proposes that phenomenal consciousness is reducible to specific neurobiological properties, such as the electrochemical activities and complex integrated systems found in sensory and post-sensory brain regions.",

    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "Neurobiological reduction based on the electrochemical nature of the brain. Conscious perception is associated with recurrent activations in perceptual areas (like visual area V5), distinct from global broadcasting required for cognitive access.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness arises from the magnificently complex and integrated system of electrochemical activity. First-order phenomenology may causally promote global broadcasting, reversing the assumption of theories like Global Workspace Theory.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized in sensory and perhaps post-sensory systems (e.g., visual cortex) requiring connectivity with the thalamus. Phenomenal consciousness is considered to 'overflow' cognitive accessibility.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Primary focus is on identity rather than function. Phenomenal consciousness may be a causal factor in promoting global broadcasting for cognitive access.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Achieved through the integrated and complex organization of the neural system's electrochemical activity.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Favors First-Order Representationalism, positing that phenomenal character is represented by analog, fine-grained intentional content in short-term memory stores, available to higher-order thoughts.",

      "Phenomenal consciousness is reducible to its physical basis in neurobiology.",
      "The electrochemical nature of neural systems is the candidate for consciousness reduction.",

    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Criticized for failing to close the explanatory gap by not making the identity statement intelligible. Block himself argues that metaphysical functionalism and reductive physicalism are incompatible rivals. Thought experiments like 'fading qualia' challenge the necessity of specific biological hardware for phenomenology.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The primary challenge is finding the specific physical property that successfully completes the reduction (the 'second step'). Must fully explain why the specific biological machinery is necessary for qualia.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Consistent with Materialist ontology; highly consistent with Mind-Brain Identity theory. Block views his position as incompatible with Functionalism as a metaphysical claim."

      "stance": "No",
      "rationale": "Block suggests that phenomenology depends on the nature of our biological machinery. Since virtual immortality relies on computational/functional replication in a non-biological medium, the phenomenal character (qualia) would likely be lost in the transfer."
