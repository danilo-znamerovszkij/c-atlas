    "theory_title": "McGinn's Ultimate Mystery (Mysterianism)",
    "summary": "The theory argues that the metaphysical bond between the conscious mind and the physical brain is an ultimate mystery which human intelligence is fundamentally incapable of solving. This cognitive closure is due to limitations inherent in our human conceptual resources, not because consciousness is supernatural.",

  "conceptual_ground": {
    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness arises solely from the material world, but the intrinsic property or nature that links matter (brain) to consciousness (mind) is conceptually inaccessible to human minds.",
    "ontological_status": "Existential Naturalism",
    "mind_body_relationship": "Consciousness is dependent on the physical world (material dependence), but the underlying causal link or identity cannot be grasped or explained by human science or philosophy.",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Emergent",
    "emergence_type": "The emergence mechanism is necessarily hidden from human intellect due to limitations in our conceptual anatomy, making it functionally indistinguishable from strong emergence in principle.",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "McGinn highlights the profound nature of the gap between physical reality and qualitative experience; he finds the notion that matter gives rise to consciousness highly implausible, likening it to asserting that 'numbers emerge from biscuits' (This profound gap constitutes the mystery).",
    "qualia_account": "The mystery hinges on the inability to relate qualitative feel (qualia) to material reality, as matter is the 'wrong kind of thing' to produce consciousness. The full explanation of qualia is fundamentally unknowable by humans.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Physical processes (brains) and conscious experience (which is accepted as real and non-supernatural). The existence of the true connection is posited, though inaccessible.",
    "epistemic_access": "Human intellect is conceptually closed off from the truth of the mind-brain bond, meaning ultimate knowledge or resolution is impossible.",
    "constituents_and_structure": "Consciousness arises from the material world, but the specific property responsible for this generation is beyond the capacity of human conceptual structures to define or comprehend."

    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal (the bond between qualia and matter); Agency (implied challenge to materialist explanations of action)",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle is cognitive closure: the human intellect cannot conceive how physical processes generate subjective experience, leading to the designation of the bond as an ultimate mystery.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is contingent; it is a complex outcome that arose solely from material processes, but the transition dynamics that bridged the physical and phenomenal domains are inaccessible.",
    "location_and_distribution": "Localized within biological brains, arising solely from the material world.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is causally produced by material processes, but the details of this causation are mysterious and cannot be specified by human reasoning.",
    "integration_or_binding": "The unified nature of experience is part of the mystery, reflecting the inability to see how unified consciousness arises from disparate material components.",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "Not explicitly addressed, as the theory focuses on the fundamental conceptual limits of relating matter to mind, rather than specifying information architecture.",
    "evolutionary_account": "Consciousness is contingent; it evolved from the material world but is not an inherent or necessary property of reality.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "The bond between mind and brain is an ultimate mystery that human intelligence will never unravel.",
      "A deep fact about our own nature as embodied consciousness is necessarily hidden from us.",

      "None specified, as the theory focuses on conceptual limitations."
    ],
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "Often criticized as Mysterianism, implying philosophical pessimism or an anti-scientific stance, although McGinn positions the view as Existential Naturalism.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise nature of the mind-brain bond remains entirely unresolved and is believed to be permanently beyond human understanding.",
    "ontological_coherence": "Consistent within the framework of cognitive closure; however, it implicitly contradicts the core belief of reductive physicalism that a complete explanation is possible, even in principle."

    "AI_consciousness": {
