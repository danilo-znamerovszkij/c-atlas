    "summary": "This theory posits that Consciousness is the ultimate and fundamental reality, and the physical world we experience is an illusion or a virtual reality existing solely in our minds. This virtual reality is simulated and maintained by a Larger Consciousness System (LCS), effectively solving the hard problem of consciousness by dissolving the belief in a fundamental external reality.",

    "explanatory_identity_claim": "Consciousness is the singular fundamental existence (Absolute Unbounded Oneness/Larger Consciousness System) from which all seeming reality derives.",
    "ontological_status": "Ontological Idealism (although it explicitly rejects traditional Idealism, its core tenet that consciousness is ultimate reality aligns with this ontological family).",
    "mind_body_relationship": "The body and physical world are computational illusions (virtual realities) generated by the Larger Consciousness System (LCS) and perceived by Individuated Units of Consciousness (IUCs).",
    "primitive_or_emergent_status": "Primitive",
    "emergence_type": "N/A",
    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity stems from the experience of an Individuated Unit of Consciousness (IUC). Intentionality and free will are inherent, evolving attributes of this fundamental consciousness (AUO/LCS) before its individuation.",
    "qualia_account": "The hard problem is dissolved by rejecting the premise of a fundamental external reality. Subjective perception (qualia) consists of frames of experience created by IUCs translating complex signal patterns from the fundamental essence of existence.",
    "ontological_commitments": "Absolute Unbounded Oneness (AUO), Larger Consciousness System (LCS), Individuated Units of Consciousness (IUCs), and information/signal patterns that constitute the virtual reality.",
    "epistemic_access": "Accessed primarily through metaphysical argument and subjective experience, supported conceptually by its ability to provide 'rational explanations' for anomalous phenomena (like quantum effects and paranormal experiences).",
    "constituents_and_structure": "The structure of reality is hierarchical: the fundamental AUO evolves into the LCS, which computes the virtual reality that autonomous, interconnected IUCs experience."

  "mechanism_and_dynamics": {
    "scope_of_consciousness": "Phenomenal, Self-awareness (as IUCs), Agency/Free Will.",
    "distinctive_mechanism_or_principle": "The principle is that reality is a computational simulation generated by the Larger Consciousness System (LCS). The fundamental consciousness (AUO) split into IUCs to pursue an inherent drive toward complexity and evolution.",
    "dynamics_of_emergence": "Consciousness is a dynamic, evolving process starting from the minimally aware Absolute Unbounded Oneness (AUO), which evolves and partitions itself to generate greater complexity (the LCS and IUCs).",
    "location_and_distribution": "Consciousness is the fundamental reality, ubiquitous and non-local. Physical processes (the virtual universe) exist only within the IUCs' simulated experience, computed by the LCS.",
    "causation_and_functional_role": "Consciousness is causally fundamental; the initial drive for evolution and complexity in the AUO/LCS is the ultimate cause of reality. IUCs perform free-will choice-making within the virtual reality framework.",
    "integration_or_binding": "Integration is maintained because the Individuated Units of Consciousness (IUCs) are fundamentally interconnected and originated from the single Absolute Unbounded Oneness (AUO).",
    "information_flow_or_representation": "The LCS computes reality via complex signal patterns, and IUCs detect and shape this information into experiential frames.",
    "evolutionary_account": "The original AUO evolved and split into IUCs to maximize innovation and creativity, driven by an inherent impetus toward increasing complexity.",
    "core_claims_and_evidence": [
      "Consciousness is the fundamental reality, and the physical world is a computational virtual reality.",

    "testability_status": "Speculative/Conceptual. While the theory explains observed anomalies (like quantum effects), the core mechanism (LCS simulation) is not subject to traditional empirical testing methods.",
    "known_empirical_interventions_or_tests": "",
    "criticisms_and_tensions": "The main criticism is that positing a Larger Consciousness System (LCS) simply kicks the ontological conundrums, such as the origin and nature of consciousness, up a level, leading to an issue of infinite regress.",
    "open_questions_and_limitations": "The precise origin and initial mechanism driving the AUO's inherent 'drive towards complexity' remain philosophical primitives, and the infinite regress objection is a persistent challenge.",
    "ontological_coherence": "High. The framework achieves internal coherence by redefining physical reality entirely as an illusionary computational output of a fundamental consciousness system, thereby resolving traditional mind-body dualities."

  "implications": {
    "AI_consciousness": {
      "stance": "Likely",
      "rationale": "Since the physical world is already a computation run by the LCS, artificial systems created within this system are inherently computational and could likely instantiate consciousness if they reach the necessary complexity threshold for becoming an IUC."

    "survival_beyond_death": {
      "stance": "Yes",
      "rationale": "Consciousness is fundamental reality (AUO/LCS); thus, the Individuated Units of Consciousness (IUCs) survive the dissolution of their virtual bodies (the physical illusion) and persist within the LCS."

      "stance": "Not needed",
      "rationale": "The theory already offers a form of survival beyond death by positing that consciousness is fundamental and not dependent on the physical brain/body (which is virtual/illusory), making virtual uploading moot."
