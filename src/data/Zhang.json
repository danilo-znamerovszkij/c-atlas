  "theoryTitle": "Zhang's Long-Distance Light-Speed Telecommunications",
  "category": "Materialism Theories",
  "summary": "Synaptic neuroscientist Ping Zhang proposes that the complex interaction between brain and mind can be resolved by positing 'light-speed telecommunication between remote cells that are arranged in parallel' within the brain [1]. This mechanism, based on a 'law of synchronization,' allows energy to be rapidly propagated and conserved, facilitating complex mental activities such as integration, imagination, remembering, and creating [1, 2]. Zhang argues that without such a 'super-highway' of light-speed connections beyond traditional synaptic networks, humans could not be intelligent life-forms [3].",
  "overview": {
    "purpose": "To collect and categorize explanations of consciousness, focusing on phenomenal experience [4].",
    "focus": "Phenomenal consciousness ('what it is like') [4].",
    "approach": "Addresses fundamental philosophical questions, not immediate truth or falsifiability, and maintains standards of rationality and clarity of argument [5]."
  },
  "components": {
    "ontologicalStatus": "Consciousness is fundamentally linked to, or constituted by, physical, light-speed electromagnetic communications and the resultant synchronization of neural activity within the brain [1-3, 6].",
    "explanatoryIdentity": "Consciousness is identified with the 'invisible 'tele' bridge-linked synchronization or harmony' that arises from clusters of traveling electrical fields produced by neural action potentials [2]. The specific form and geometry of these synchronized patterns are postulated to define conscious experiences [7].",
    "functionAndEvolution": {
      "function": "This light-speed synchronization of rhythmic action potentials provides transient, rapid, and flexible connections that are crucial for complex mental activities such as integration, imagination, remembering, and creating, thus enabling human intelligence [2, 3, 8].",
      "evolution": "As a Materialism Theory, consciousness is understood as an evolved biological phenomenon. Zhang's theory implies that the development of this 'super-highway' of light-speed communication was a necessary evolutionary step for the emergence of intelligent life forms like humans, supporting higher-level cognitive functions [3, 9-11]."
    },
    "causation": "The theory posits a direct causal relationship where traveling electrical fields mediate the transmission and synchronization of action potentials between neurons, and these physical processes directly give rise to mental activities and conscious experience [2, 6, 8].",
    "location": "Consciousness is located within the brain, specifically arising from and distributed through the 'light-speed rigid network' of synchronized traveling electrical fields that link remote cells arranged in parallel [1, 2, 6].",
    "arguments": [

        "description": "Zhang challenges the sufficiency of traditional synaptic networks and the 'smartness' of individual receptors to explain human intelligence and the mind-brain puzzle. He argues that a 'super-highway (light speed)' of inter-cellular communication, based on traveling electrical fields, is necessary for complex cognitive functions and intelligent life [1, 3].",

  "bigQuestions": {
    "ultimateMeaning": "As a Materialism Theory, Zhang's framework implies no ultimate meaning or purpose inherent in the universe beyond what humans create for themselves [12].",
    "aiConsciousness": "As a Materialism Theory, the possibility of AI consciousness is considered 'absolutely sure' in principle, suggesting that if the underlying physical and computational mechanisms (like light-speed telecommunication) can be replicated, AI could achieve consciousness [13].",
    "virtualImmortality": "If Materialism Theories, such as Zhang's, fully explain consciousness, then virtual immortality would be attainable. A perfect duplication of the physical states, including the specified light-speed electrical field interactions, would allow for the uploading of the first-person mental self [14]."
  },
  "philosophicalFocus": {
    "mindBodyProblem": "Zhang's theory addresses the mind-body problem by proposing that consciousness is fundamentally physical, arising from electromagnetic field interactions within the brain, thus providing a materialist solution to the hard problem of consciousness [2, 6].",
    "consciousnessNature": "The theory focuses on phenomenal consciousness, describing how complex inner experiences, such as integration, imagination, remembering, and creating, arise from the synchronized and harmonious activity of specialized electrical fields within the brain [2, 4].",
    "primitiveVsEmergent": "Consciousness is considered an emergent property, arising from the complex, synchronized activity of neural electrical fields and their light-speed interactions, rather than being a fundamental or primitive aspect of reality [2, 3].",
    "reductionism": "The theory supports a form of reductionism, arguing that consciousness can be fully explained in terms of physical processes, specifically the electromagnetic field interactions and synchronization patterns within the brain [2, 6, 8]."
