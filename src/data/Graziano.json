    "summary": "Attention Schema Theory (AST) proposes that consciousness arises when the brain constructs a simplified model of its own attention process (the 'attention schema') in order to monitor and regulate attention. The introspective experience of this model is reported as a 'ghostly, non-physical essence' or self-caricature.",

    "subjectivity_and_intentionality": "Subjectivity arises because the brain interprets and reports its attention schema as an internal, non-physical essence, giving rise to a first-person perspective.",
    "qualia_account": "The qualitative feel corresponds to the introspection and report of the attention schema, which leads to the false metaphysical attribution of properties like a non-physical essence.",

      "rationale": "Since consciousness is based on computational organization (the schema/model), the self could potentially be uploaded if the relevant information dynamics and representations are perfectly reproduced in non-biological media."
